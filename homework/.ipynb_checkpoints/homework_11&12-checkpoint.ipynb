    "* Remember that these homework work as a completion grade. The homework is structured in two parts: (1) Information Retrieval from a fact base and (2) claim verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In this notebook, we will build an automated claim verification system for scientific claims based on the [SciFact dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14974). \n",
    "\n",
    "* In case you need additional computational resources (GPUs), please get in touch. It is possible to solve the homework (on a downsampled dataset) without these. If you want to build really cool systems, you probably want to use the whole dataset and train models which require compute not feasible on your local machine -- get in touch.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Next, the best models to date on this dataset perform poorly. If you build a system yielding competitive scores, it is possible to do follow-up work! There exists a [global leaderboard](https://leaderboard.allenai.org/scifact/submissions/public) where you can submit test set results if you like. The [baseline system](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14974) achieves around 40% F1, we have built a system in January and obtain 55% F1, the [current state of the art](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11930.pdf) is at around 65% F1 -- there exists ample room for improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can find the github repo for SciFact with additional information (and possibly example code which could be usueful for solving this exercise) [here](https://github.com/allenai/scifact).\n",
    "\n",
    "* For the first part of the assignment, we don't expect you to train your own transformer model, but you obviously can. For the second part of the assignment, we expect you to train your own textual entailment model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lastly, We don't expect you to have a competitive system at the end of this homework, anything works as long as you have put in some effort.\n",

    "**All instructions provided can be substituted by your own ideas and only serve as a rough guideline for how to tackle the task!**\n",

    "* If you want, it is also possible to build a similar system for question answering (e.g. [SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/explore/1.1/dev/)), automated fact checking (e.g. [Climate-FEVER](https://www.sustainablefinance.uzh.ch/en/research/climate-fever.html), [FEVER](https://fever.ai/)) or other involved NLP tasks completely freestyle on a dataset of your choice. If so, please get in touch with a suggestion.\n",
