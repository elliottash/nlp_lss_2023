The task is to determine how semantically similar two texts are and is a popular dataset to evaluate document embeddings, i.e. we want embeddings of two semantically similar documents to be similar as well. We provide a wordcounts baseline for this task and ask you to compute and evaluate embeddings for a selected sample of document embedding techniques.\n",
