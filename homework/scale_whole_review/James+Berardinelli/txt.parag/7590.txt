Unemployment is a bane almost everyone can appreciate -- a=20 universal affliction that becomes a sobering reality for many people=20 during even the best of economic times. And, while the loss of each=20 individual job is traumatic, that's nothing compared to what happens=20 when the livelihood and identity of an entire community are jeopardized=20 by a round of mass layoffs. BRASSED OFF!, written and directed by Mark=20 Herman, takes a look at the plight of the British coal miner -- a dying=20 breed. Once, mining was a thriving industry in rural England, with=20 whole towns built around each mine. But, during the early 1980s, the=20 Tory government began converting the country to nuclear power. The=20 resulting drop in demand devastated the coal industry, with hundreds of=20 pits being closed and a quarter of a million miners made "redundant." =20
Grimley Colliery is a mine on the verge of shutting down. The pit,=20 which employs more than 1000 miners, has been targeted for closure, but,=20 to sweeten the bitter taste for the workers, a healthy severance package=20 has been offered. Still, there are those who are willing to fight to=20 the end, believing that no amount of money can make up for the damage=20 that Grimley's closure will bring. Among the most vocal of the anti- closing brigade are Andy (Ewan McGregor), a brash, young miner whose=20 lungs are still relatively clean, and Phil (Stephen Tompkinson), a=20 family man who's deep in debt and needs his job to make ends meet. =20 Meanwhile, Phil's father, Danny (Pete Postlethwaite), wants the mine to=20 stay open for a different reason. He's the conductor of the Grimley=20 Colliery Brass Band (in fact, it's his life), and, if the mine closes,=20 the band will come to an end. In fact, several members are considering=20 tendering their resignations to Danny when a pretty young trumpet=20 player, Gloria (Tara Fitzgerald), arrives in town and asks to sit in on=20 the practice sessions.
BRASSED OFF! is a traditional feel-good motion picture with an=20 element of social commentary thrown in for good measure. The film might=20 have been stronger had it displayed a little more anger throughout=20 instead of opting for a big speech at the end to get the point across,=20 but at least it imparts a measure of the pain that unemployment can=20 cause. And BRASSED OFF! is less glib than Michael Moore's ROGER AND ME=20 in pursuing a similar aim. While Moore's chief goal was a caustic=20 attack against General Motors, BRASSED OFF! shows the human toll of mass=20 layoffs.
Even though two of the most prominent names in the cast are rising=20 stars Ewan McGregor (TRAINSPOTTING) and Tara Fitzgerald (THE ENGLISHMAN=20 WHO WENT UP A HILL=85), their performances are among the least noteworthy. = =20 The best acting turn belongs to Pete Postlethwaite (IN THE NAME OF THE=20 FATHER), whose Danny is poignant and proud, followed closely by such=20 British stalwarts as Jim Carter, Philip Jackson, Peter Martin, and=20 Stephen Tompkinson. If Danny represents BRASSED OFF!'s heart, then the=20 miners represent its body and soul. =20
Actually, McGregor and Fitzgerald appear to be on hand largely to=20 inject some youthful appeal into the film. Neither of their characters=20 is particularly necessary or effective. However, without their rather=20 unconvincing romantic subplot, the movie probably wouldn't reach as wide=20 an audience. They may not do much, but they're there, and their=20 characters fall in love. That will be enough for certain viewers who=20 would otherwise ignore a dramatic comedy about a bunch of old geezers=20 who play in a colliery brass band.
The plot itself is littered with familiar feel-good elements: the=20 big competition, the critical illness of a key character (win one for=20 the Gipper!), and the redemption of someone who's viewed as a betrayer. =20 Despite this, or perhaps partially because of it, BRASSED OFF!=20 successfully presents its theme without ever becoming overbearing. =20 Certainly, this isn't a hard-hitting motion picture like GERMINAL, but=20 its heart is in the right place, it has a great soundtrack, and it keeps=20 the viewer entertained. Anyone seeing BRASSED OFF! for its lighter,=20 less effective elements (the love story, the band competition) should at=20 least understand the message that Mark Herman is conveying.=20
