There's a lot of Academy Award potential in WRESTLING ERNEST HEMINGWAY. Not only is the cast a virtual who's-who of past nominees and winners in the acting categories, but director Randa Haines was responsible for the highly-regarded William Hurt/Marlee Matlin drama CHILDREN OF A LESSER GOD.
Frank (Richard Harris) and Walt (Robert Duvall) are both loners. Frank is something of a loose cannon--he answers the door in the nude, gets drunk on Irish whiskey, and tells stories about a time in 1938 when he wrestled Ernest Hemingway. Walt, on the other hand, is neat and orderly. Twice daily he goes to the local Sweetwater Diner, where he orders a bacon sandwich from a pretty waitress named Elaine (Sandra Bullock), for whom he secretly carries a torch. Then, one day in a park, Frank meets Walt, and neither of their lives will be the same. For each of them, the other means something they don't have--a friend.
WRESTLING ERNEST HEMINGWAY shows what an excellent cast can do with an average script. Steve Conrad's debut screenplay says little that hasn't been presented before, but the actors make it seem fresher and more powerful than it has a right to be. Stripped down to its essentials, this is a buddy film that also tackles the issue of coping with old age and its accompanying loss of virility. There's no attempt to break new ground, and no sense that the script is willing to take chances. You can predict the ending long before it comes to pass.
Robert Duvall always assures a director of a solid performance, and Walt is one of his best-acted roles in years. Even though Duvall is easily twenty years younger than his character, there's never a credibility problem. He plays Walt with a simple sensitivity that's at times poignant or humorous. Duvall's abilities are so chameleon-like that it's difficult to believe that this is the same man from another current release, GERONIMO. "Oscar-worthy" is an overused term, but it applies in this case.
It's been a long time since Richard Harris turned in a bad day's work (possibly ORCA, and that was fifteen years ago). Not many of his films have been box office successes, but Harris' performances have never been the problem. WRESTLING ERNEST HEMINGWAY adds another feather to his cap. Harris' Frank isn't developed with the subtlety of Duvall's Walt, but Frank is a much more boisterous and raucous personality. Harris knows who he's playing, and succeeds brilliantly in bringing him to life.
The three women have supporting roles. Sandra Bullock is likable as Elaine, the only under-fifty member of the cast. Shirley MacLaine doesn't have much to do as Helen Coonie, but she asserts her presence effectively in two pivotal scenes. Piper Laurie's Georgia is pretty much a wasted character, and Ms. Laurie's performance is the only one that's below the expected level.
As is the case with many movies that deal with friendship and aging issues, WRESTLING ERNEST HEMINGWAY doesn't go anywhere. That's not really a problem, but the total length of the movie could have been cut by about fifteen minutes without losing anything. This film doesn't need to be two hours long.
Humor and pathos are nicely mixed, but this is expected from any moderately-successful entry into the genre. In may ways, this is the male version of THE CEMETERY CLUB, with many of the same themes confronted from the other gender's point-of-view. WRESTLING ERNEST HEMINGWAY is more entertaining--THE CEMETERY CLUB never quite clicked--but those who have seen both films will recognize the similarities.
Warner Brothers is having a hard time promoting WRESTLING ERNEST HEMINGWAY, and the likely result will be a poor showing at the box office. They have an understandable problem, since the movie doesn't offer a whole lot of quick clips to attract viewers. It's a shame, really, because while this movie has its fair share of flaws, there is an audience for it. The problem is that they probably won't know that it exists.
