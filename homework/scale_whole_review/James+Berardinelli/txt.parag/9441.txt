In the short, 221-year history of the United States of America, there has never been any royalty. No barons, dukes, princes, and, especially, kings or queens. The closest we have ever come was during the Kennedy years in the White House, but their reign was cut short by an assassin's bullet on November 22, 1963. Nevertheless, somewhat inexplicably, the mystique still lingers, long after JFK and his wife have departed this life. Mark Waters' darkly funny THE HOUSE OF YES provides a cutting look at the country's obsession with the Kennedys – a topic that seems apropos in light of the ghoulish fascination regarding Princess Diana.
Going home to meet your fiance's family seems like the normal thing to do. Intimidating, perhaps, but normal. And Lesly (Tori Spelling) is a very normal girl, albeit not a particularly bright one. In fact, that's why Marty Pascal (Josh Hamilton) is attracted to her - he has a craving for normalcy, something that he never got from his family. His twin sister, Jackie-O (Parker Posey), is obsessed with the former First Lady, even going so far as to dress up as her and stage re-creations of JFK's final moments. And the relationship between Marty and Jackie-O isn't a typical sibling connection; it's more like a brother/sister affair. Mom (Genevieve Bujold) and little brother Anthony (Freddie Prinze Jr.) are aware of the situation, but, in the best interests of all involved, they turn a blind eye.
Then, on Thanksgiving Day in 1983, Marty shows up at his Washington D.C. home in the midst of a hurricane. He's not alone - Lesly, the proud bearer of a new engagement ring, is with him. Jackie-O's reaction upon learning that her beloved brother is no longer all hers is to let out a piercing scream. Mom is a little more reserved. On her way back into the kitchen, she calmly notes, "I'm going to go baste the turkey and hide the kitchen knives." Over the next twenty-four hours, Lesly will learn all there is to know about Marty and Jackie-O while capturing Anthony's affection and earning Mom's enmity.
Although THE HOUSE OF YES is dark, bleak, and occasionally disturbing, it is subversively funny - and I mean laugh-aloud funny. Admittedly, most of the humor is warped (how else could you describe a comedy with central themes of incest and an obsession with JFK's assassination), but it would take an exceedingly bland viewer not to find at least a few amusing elements in the film. Consider, for example, the delightfully matter-of-fact manner in which Genevieve Bujold delivers her biting dialogue. Or the wonderfully off-the-wall way in which Parker Posey brings Jackie-O to demented life.
In fact, while Posey is obviously the film's acting standout, she is ably supported. Josh Hamilton, a familiar face from Generation X movies, is believable as a brother torn between a carnal desire for his sister and her games, and a need for the kind of normal life he has always been denied. Freddie Prinze, currently appearing in I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, shows an almost-creepy timidity as Anthony. And, perhaps most surprising of all given her dubious reputation, Tori Spelling is fine as the dim Lesly.
THE HOUSE OF YES is what happens when a film takes the dysfunctional family melodrama to its farthest reaches. It's a bold, gutsy movie that's definitely not for everyone. But, for those who are always looking for the next daring motion picture and who aren't offended by off-color humor, THE HOUSE OF YES offers 90 minutes of solid entertainment. Not every chance taken by Mark Waters works, but enough are successful to produce some memorable motion picture moments.
