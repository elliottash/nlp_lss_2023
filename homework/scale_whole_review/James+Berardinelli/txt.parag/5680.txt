There's nothing particularly deep or challenging about this movie. The title, FLED, says it all. For most of its one-hundred minute running length, this is one chase after another. When the film keeps moving, and doesn't dwell on things like character development or plot plausibility, it offers a certain minimum entertainment value. Unfortunately, there are lulls when attempts are made at exposition, and, during those periods, FLED becomes unbearably dull, not to mention incredibly stupid.
Actually, Kevin Hooks' energetic direction, coupled with Laurence Fishburne's commanding presence, makes this picture more watchable than it has a right to be. Aside from occasional, clever quips (such as tongue-in-cheek references to THE FUGITIVE and Fishburne's Oscar- nominated performance in WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT), there's nothing remarkable about the creaky script, which does everything it possibly can to keep the two leads on the run from good guys, bad guys, and everyone in between. Logic and intelligence have little part in these proceedings.
Since the film opens with a black guy, Piper (Fishburne), and a white guy, Dodge (Stephen Baldwin), chained together and on the run, it's reasonable to connect FLED with Stanley Kramer's 1958 feature, THE DEFIANT ONES, which starred Tony Curtis and Sidney Poitier. The similarities are purely superficial, however. THE DEFIANT ONES was a multi-layered film; FLED is pure escapism with nothing under the surface. It's stock bits of LETHAL WEAPON, THE FUGITIVE, and 48 HOURS rolled into one.
Piper and Dodge are working on a Georgia prison work gang when all hell breaks loose. A prisoner gets a gun and starts shooting, killing guards and inmates indiscriminately. Piper and Dodge, who are chained together, escape. Apparently, however, someone on the outside has orchestrated their break-out. Dodge, a top hacker, possesses a computer disk containing incriminating information about a major figure in the Cuban mob. Now everyone wants Dodge and his disk, including the mob's class-A hitman, the police, and crooked federal agents. (Bad Feds again -- haven't these guys been the villains in every other movie this summer?) During the course of the flight for life, the fugitives are helped by Dodge's exotic dancer girlfriend (Brittney Powell) and a pretty divorcee (Salma Hayek) who shows interest in Piper.
Stephen Baldwin, one of the interchangeable acting Baldwin brothers, is adequate, and Salma Hayek (DESPERADO) is attractive, but FLED's attention magnet is Fishburne. A consummate professional, he has never turned in a sub-par performance, regardless of the quality (or lack thereof) of his role. He's a good friend of Hooks', which explains his presence here, but those who sit through this movie won't care why he appears -- they'll just be glad he does. Otherwise, enduring the film would be far more difficult.
There's not much else to be said about FLED. It's not a complete entertainment wasteland, but this is definitely not the time of year to distribute such a routine, unspectacular action feature. It probably would have played better against less imposing competition. So, although FLED hints at the promise of its director, who previously made PASSENGER 57, it's not the kind of picture that will get people racing to theaters. When the movie's over, you're likely to be left feeling that, despite all the running around, you really haven't gotten anywhere.
