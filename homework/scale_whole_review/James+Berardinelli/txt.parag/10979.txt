A missing cufflink. A misplaced watch. A lost set of keys. In general, we attribute these absences to a faulty memory, but could there be another explanation? What if there are little people, half Lilliputian and half leprechaun, who delight in filching such items out from under our noses? They live under the floorboards of our houses, and only emerge when the coast is clear to do their "borrowing," then are gone before any human can see them. That's the premise of THE BORROWERS, a new family film from director Peter Hewitt based on the series of children's books by Mary Norton.
Loosely speaking, THE BORROWERS belongs to the HOME ALONE genre (clever, little underdogs defeat big, bulky bad guys while inflicting enormous physical discomfort upon the villains), which might be something of a surprise to those who hold the Norton books in high esteem. This movie comes across very much like the aforementioned HOME ALONE meets GULLIVER'S TRAVELS, and bears more than a passing resemblance to last year's MOUSEHUNT, which was also about something hiding behind the walls and under the floors (although there it was a mouse; here, it's tiny people).
THE BORROWERS presents its tale from two perspectives: that of the normal-sized humans and that of the 4-inch high borrowers. The fact that there's solid characterizations on both ends of the size spectrum is what makes this film more successful than many features with similar skeletal plotlines. In THE BORROWERS, the viewer isn't forced to identify with an animatronic rodent or an irritating child actor. Instead, the film makers offer Pod Clock (Jim Broadbent); his wife, Homily (Celia Imire); and their children, teenager Arrietty (Flora Newbigin), and nine-year old Peagreen (Tom Felton). All four, despite their diminutive size, are solidly-developed and likable. Meanwhile, on the larger scale, there's Pete Lender (Bradley Pierce), the human boy who befriends the borrower family. The villain is the nefarious Ocious P. Potter (John Goodman).
The story goes something like this: Pete's family is being forced to move out of their house because the unscrupulous Potter has stolen the will that leaves the property to them. The house is to be torn down to make way for apartment buildings (the first dwellings in a proposed development called "Pottersville" -- I wonder if someone saw IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE?), so Pete, who recently discovered that a family of borrowers live under the floorboards, informs his new friends that they have to depart. However, in transit to the new house, the borrower children become separated from their parents. Arrietty and Peagreen return to the old dwelling in time to learn that Potter has cheated Pete's family out of their rightful property. So the two young borrowers set out to rectify matters.
Much of the violence found in THE BORROWERS is of the live-action cartoon variety -- that is to say, it's wildly exaggerated and no one really gets hurt. Overall, it's not as mean-spirited as we've come to expect from this sort of movie. Aside from a massive electrical shock, nothing horrible happens to anyone. No irons fall on people's heads, no one tumbles out of a third-story window, and no one gets tarred and feathered. "Tame" might be the best word to describe scenes in which the villain is spraypainted in the face, has a needle stuck in his posterior, and gets a vat of liquid cheese dumped on his head.
In bringing this comedic fantasy-adventure to life, director Peter Hewitt (BILL AND TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY) is ably assisted by a fine troupe of actors who hail from both sides of the Atlantic. John Goodman, who seems to be omnipresent these days (this is the third movie in four days that I've seen him in -- the other two are BLUES BROTHERS 2000 and THE BIG LEBOWSKI), enjoys himself immensely as the larger-than-life Potter, who doesn't have a kind bone in his body. Jim Broadbent, the fine British thespian, brings life and character to Pod. Newcomer Flora Newbigin is incandescent as Arrietty. Amusing supporting roles are filled by Mark Williams (as Potter's henchman, Jeff, the "Pest Control Operative") and Hugh Laurie (as an ultra-helpful policeman).
One of the nicest surprises about THE BORROWERS is that it's not only charming, but genuinely funny. Granted, there aren't many belly laughs, but the screenplay offers plenty of opportunities for smiles and chuckles, and there's nothing here that kids need to be shielded from. Likewise, THE BORROWERS stays at a high enough level to involve adults. Aside from the solid cast and the entertaining script, the movie also boasts an impressive look. The city where THE BORROWERS takes place resembles a generic 1950s American metropolis with a slightly gothic appearance -- sort of a lighter version of BATMAN's Gotham City. From time-to-time, some offbeat bit of humor coupled with the creative set design generates a distant echo of Terry Gilliam's brilliant BRAZIL. Best of all, however, is that THE BORROWERS doesn't limit its capacity for pleasure to any particular age group. It's the most delightful family film thus far in 1998.
