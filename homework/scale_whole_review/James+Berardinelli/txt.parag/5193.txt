Here's to you, Mrs. Robinson=85 =20
Matt Reeves' THE PALLBEARER is loaded with none-to-subtle=20 references to Mike Nichols' 1967 classic, THE GRADUATE. The problem is=20 that this mediocre toast to the past has lost its fizz, resulting in a=20 bland concoction that's as devoid of originality as it is of warmth and=20 humor. =20
Oh, there are occasionally funny moments, but those are outnumbered=20 by instances when THE PALLBEARER makes its audience feel uncomfortable. =20 There is a funereal atmosphere, and even the most "lighthearted" scenes=20 are handled with a heavy hand. This is the most grim comedy since=20 MURIEL'S WEDDING, but THE PALLBEARER is neither as well-written nor as=20 deftly directed.
Only in the movies could a guy like David Schwimmer find himself=20 the romantic target of both Gwyneth Paltrow and Barbara Hershey. =20 Schwimmer plays Tom Thomas, a directionless, post-college architect=20 who's looking for a job, financial independence, and a way out of him=20 mother's house. One day, Tom gets a phone call from a distressed woman,=20 Ruth Abernathy (Hershey), who wants Tom to be a pallbearer at her son's=20 funeral. Tom doesn't remember the dead guy, but, unable to refuse a=20 crying woman, he agrees. Meanwhile, Julie DeMarco (Paltrow), a high=20 school classmate Tom had a crush on, moves back to town, and he=20 convinces her to go out with him. Complications arise when his attempts=20 to comfort Ruth develop into a sexual relationship, and Tom finds=20 himself caught between two women.
There are some cute scenes between Schwimmer and Paltrow, but the=20 pairing with Hershey doesn't generate any heat or pathos. Two of the=20 characters in the film, Tom's Mom (played by Carol Kane) and his best=20 friend, Brad (Michael Rapaport), are irritating beyond belief. Rapaport=20 (BEAUTIFUL GIRLS) is normally annoying, so this is no surprise, but Kane=20 (THE PRINCESS BRIDE) is typically likable.
Ultimately, the real problem is that THE PALLBEARER is a real=20 downer -- and it's more than just the title. From the dark=20 cinematography, glum tone, and stagnant humor to the uninspired=20 direction, there aren't many reasons to like this film. While it's not=20 a terrible example of movie making, it represents a clear picture of=20 mediocrity, and those hoping to see a '90s version of THE GRADUATE will=20 be disappointed. THE PALLBEARER doesn't have what it takes to make the=20 grade.
