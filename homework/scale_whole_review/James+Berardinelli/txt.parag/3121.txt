Those leaving FEDERAL HILL with a strong sense of deja vu can be forgiven for that impression. With the possible exception of utilizing an atypical location (Providence, Rhode Island's Federal Hill as opposed to New York City or Long Island), there is little in this film that hasn't been done before, and better.
With a moody score and crisp black-and-white cinematography, the opening scene of FEDERAL HILL, which features the burglary of an upscale Providence residence, promises a lot more than the rest of the film is able to deliver. From this point on, the movie quickly degenerates into an amalgamation of situations and characters pilfered from such efforts as AMONGST FRIENDS, A BRONX TALE, and others.
The story centers around a group of five twenty-something friends: Ralph (Nicholas Turturro), Nicky (Anthony De Sando), Frank (Michael Raynor), Bobby (Jason Andrews), and Joey (Robert Turano), each of whom is given a subplot that contributes to the whole. Ralph, the son of a mentally ill bricklayer, does his work by night, getting both his kicks and his income from robbing rich people's houses. Nicky, Ralph's best friend and cousin, is a small-time cocaine dealer. Frank, the son of a local mobster (GOODFELLAS' Frank Vincent), is constantly trying to prove his worth. Bobby is a loser in debt for $30,000 to a loan shark, and Joey is an ex-con trying to deal with a nagging wife. Also thrown into the mix is Wendy (Libby Langdon), a Brown University student who becomes involved with Nicky.
The interaction of these characters, which is intended to form the backbone of FEDERAL HILL, is more than passingly reminiscent of what went on in Rob Weiss' AMONGST FRIENDS, a far better chronicle of fractured friendships and criminal appeal. Moments of originality are scarce here. Apparently, writer/director Michael Corrente found it less demanding to plunder previous genre entries than strike out in a new direction.
Character development is sketchy at best, with no real growth apparent in anyone. This is certainly due in large part to a script that is more concerned with a story than with those the story is about, but the weak (and largely inexperienced) cast cannot be completely absolved. With the exceptions of Nicholas Turturro, whose performance as Ralph is suitably manic, and the vastly-underused Frank Vincent, none of the actors excel. Especially disappointing are Anthony De Sando and Libby Langdon, who are frequently unconvincing in central roles. The supposed chemistry between them never gives off more than fitful sparks.
It has been repeatedly proven that, when a connection is made with the audience, unpleasant characters often make the most fascinating protagonists (for a recent example, take a look at Quentin Tarantino's PULP FICTION). In FEDERAL HILL, however, Corrente's attempts to forge that link are largely unsuccessful, resulting in a bunch of small-time hoods that it's difficult to care about one way or another.
It's somewhat mystifying why this film has received acclaim at several international film festivals. Perhaps there is a fascination with certain, admittedly-colorful elements of the Italian-American community (this is no GODFATHER or GOODFELLAS, but vestiges of those pictures' "flavor" has been retained). Regardless, despite a solidly- constructed story line, FEDERAL HILL is one of the least innovative or interesting American independent films to come along this year.
