TRAVELLER, the directorial debut of veteran cinematographer Jack Green, takes us into the world of blood-related grifters who pull two- bit cons as a way of life. They are the "Travellers", a close-knit band of Irish-American nomads who survive by preying on the gullibility and greed of others. This movie tells the story of one such Traveller and the forces that lead him to question his position within the society.
Bokky (Bill Paxton) is near the top of the North Carolina Traveller hierarchy. He is respected by his peers, and the local leader, Boss Jack (Luke Askew), regards him as the son he never had. One Fall day, a young man, Pat (Mark Wahlberg), arrives to bury his exiled Traveller father in a Traveller cemetery, and is met with cold stares and harsh words. As an outsider, he is regarded with suspicion, but the Traveller blood in his veins runs true and Bokky agrees to take Pat under his wing. Soon, the two have become a team and are pulling off some pretty profitable schemes. Everything is going smoothly until Bokky falls for Jean (Julianna Margulies), one of his intended victims, and his loyalties become confused.
The plot of TRAVELLER, credited to Jim McGlynn, isn't all that complex or hard to follow. It's episodic in nature, with each new scam representing another chapter. The cons are fun to watch unfold. Sometimes, it's possible to see where they're going, sometimes not. The script is smart and sneaky -- by never telling the audience more than is necessary, it develops a keen sense of suspense that persists until the gritty final reel.
The great strength of the film, however, is character development. The two leads, Bokky and Pat, both have clearly-defined arcs. Pat, desperate to prove himself to Boss Jack, works hard to learn the tricks of the trade. Meanwhile, Bokky, even while teaching Pat how to scam people, is starting to see his marks as human beings, and his resolve to rip them off is beginning to waver. He is suddenly reluctant to swindle a young couple out of their life's savings.
For the most part, the acting is top-notch. Bill Paxton, taking a brief hiatus from blockbusters like TWISTER to do a serious role in a low-budget feature, brings charm, depth, and feeling to a part that could have come across as cold and amoral. Julianna Margulies (PARADISE ROAD, TV's ER) smolders in this low-key performance. Character actor James Gammon is delightful as a fellow scam artist who turns Pat and Bokky's duo into a trio. Even Mark Wahlberg (the former Marky Mark), not known for his acting, is competent.
Here and there, TRAVELLER takes a wrong turn. The culture of the band, which is arguably the most absorbing feature of the film, is worthy of a more thorough exploration than is offered. We're teased with a possible romantic relationship between Pat and the Boss' daughter (Nikki DeLoach), which might have uncovered another dimension of Traveller society, but this subplot is abruptly dropped during the movie's second half. Indeed, there are several occasions when TRAVELLER glosses over things that cry out for greater investigation (such as Bokky's lessons about how to pull a successful scam). Still, these are mostly small gripes, and their impact upon the viewing experience as a whole is minimal. TRAVELLER, the latest in a sub-genre that's becoming known as "Southern Gothic" (and includes the likes of ONE FALSE MOVE and SLING BLADE), is a fine film, and worth a trip to a theater.
