Sitting through IRON WILL is a little like watching a video tape of a sports game where you already know the final score. There isn't any tension about who will win, but there are a few moments of passing excitement along the way. This movie is among those that will enthrall children without, for the most part, causing adults to gnash their teeth.
Following the death of his father in a dog-sledding accident, Will Stoneman (Mackenzie Austin) must find the money to pay for his college education and save his family's farm from debt collectors. Entering a 500-mile dogsled race with a $10,000 cash prize seems the best solution. So, after a month's intensive training, he and his team of dogs head north to the starting line in Canada. After a newspaper reporter (Kevin Spacey) pays his late registration fee, Will's arrival into the elite group of racers engenders reactions from companionable friendship to outright hostility. Once the race begins, however, it doesn't take long for Will to convince everyone that he isn't just a kid out to prove himself--he has the drive and ability to win.
As an adventure film, IRON WILL has several energetic and exciting sequences, almost all of which occur during the race. Unfortunately, these battles of man-against-nature are punctuated by frequent "character-building" moments, which include atrocious dialogue and wooden acting. That means that only about half the movie works on any level.
IRON WILL is big on patriotism. Taking place on the eve of the United States' entry into World War One, there's a lot of flag waving, and the newspaper headlines boldly declare that Iron Will is America's new hero. While there are plot reasons for this stars-and-stripes worship, they hardly justifies the excesses to which the movie goes.
No one turns in a better-than-serviceable performance, although the actors should be commended for enduring the necessary conditions to shoot the race sequences. Duluth (where IRON WILL was filmed) can be frigid in the winter, and the snow and ice are the real things.
The villain is bald-headed Borg Guillarson (George Gerdes), who lacks any redeemable qualities. He spends the whole movie taunting Will until the two have their predictable final clash on the approach to the finish line (the manner of the resolution, however, is a little different from what one might expect). Although overacted by Gerdes (as is the case with most comic book-type nasties), Borg is the only character who doesn't come across as totally bland.
There are major problems with the ending, which is perhaps the most disgustingly-manipulative five minutes since the finale of SCENT OF A WOMAN. The idea is to get the audience to cheer, but I found myself struggling not to lose my lunch.
Director Charles Haid (from TV's HILL STREET BLUES) does a good job with the action sequences, but his film loses its focus whenever a dramatic moment is called for. This makes for an irritatingly-erratic tone. IRON WILL would have been best served with a minimal plot, since most of what's present manages only to slow things down.
Even without the Disney logo at the beginning, there's no doubt who the distributor is. IRON WILL's presentation of family values and reliance upon formulas are distinctive. The film has enough action to keep it from becoming boring, but there are too many flaws for this to be considered anything more grand than adequate entertainment.
