WARRIORS OF VIRTUE is a great title. Unfortunately, it's not a great movie. The film, a family-oriented fantasy-adventure, is an amalgamation of Asian mysticism, cartoon violence, J.R.R. Tolkien, STAR WARS, and THE WIZARD OF OZ. For originality, coherence, and intelligence, it's on par with STARGATE and INDEPENDENCE DAY. For entertainment, it's a notch below.
The film opens with an ominous, disembodied voice declaring, "I remember a world with no wars, no warriors. But now all that has changed." It seems that the evil warlord Komodo (Angus Macfadyen) has been systematically destroying the energy source of the mythical world of Tao in order to prolong his life. Now, in the planet's most dire hour, Komodo is preparing his armies to march against the surviving population. The situation looks bleak until the arrival of "The Newcomer", a.k.a. Ryan Jeffers (Mario Yedidia), an ordinary Earth teen who is transported to Tao when he accidentally drowns. Ryan brings with him the fabled "Manuscript of Legend," a book that tells how to defeat the dark forces arrayed against Tao. Unfortunately, Komodo's minions steal it from Ryan before he can present it to Tao's quintet of defenders, the kangaroo-like "Warriors of Virtue", and their teacher, Master Chung (Chao-Li Chi).
The basic story is a variation on the age-old struggle between good and evil, although, in WARRIORS OF VIRTUE, it's heavily leavened with mystical and anti-violence messages. The latter seem rather hypocritical, for, although the film hammers home the moral that killing is evil, it doesn't have a problem with the concept of applying a vicious beating to a foe. The kung fu battle sequences, while choreographed with flair, are often brutal, and the lack of blood only makes them seem more sanitized.
WARRIORS OF VIRTUE is a little to juvenile to be enjoyable for anyone past puberty. The film, with its shallow symbols (such as a cocoon in a jar) and sermonizing, displays little thematic or character depth. The plot is perfunctory and obvious, and the special effects used to animate the five partially-animatronic warriors are barely adequate. The set design is impressive, but that doesn't mean much amidst all the other woes. For good measure, a healthy dose of pop Chinese mysticism is injected into the script. This has the unfortunate effect of making WARRIORS OF VIRTUE seem like a STAR WARS rip-off, with Master Chung taking the Obi-Wan Kenobi role -- teaching his young charge, dying in a battle-to-the-death with the Dark Lord, then returning as a spirit to give invaluable advice.
The movie's most interesting character, a girl named Alyssia (Marley Shelton), is criminally underused. Alyssia is torn between good and evil, trapped between the desire to do right and Komodo's seductive allure. She's the only one in the film that we develop any real interest in, and the script, apparently unable to deal with a personality having the potential to display more than one dimension, discards her perfunctorily and inelegantly.
The acting in WARRIORS OF VIRTUE can be counted among its most serious flaws. Director Ronnie Yu (THE BRIDE WITH WHITE HAIR), one of many Hong Kong film makers migrating to the West, has an excellent visual sense, but, at least in this case, he is incapable of culling solid performances out of his cast members. The young lead, Mario Yedidia (JACK), is teeth-grindingly awful, displaying a complete inability to convey any emotion subtly. Yedidia's "performance" makes you appreciate the quality evident in the work of his many superior peers. Angus Macfadyen (Robert the Bruce in BRAVEHEART) is distinctly unimpressive, with a generic, over-the-top style that's more laughable than effective. There's nothing remotely sinister about Komodo -- he looks like a rock star in need of a good night's sleep. Marley Shelton and Chao-Li Chi are merely adequate in supporting parts. I suppose the five actors trapped beneath the Warrior costumes deserve some kind of recognition for what they endured to lend their creature-characters a semblance of life.
Fantasy films have an extremely poor motion picture history, perhaps because it's so difficult for a movie to capture the kind of pure magic that exists only in the imagination. WARRIORS OF VIRTUE is an abysmal entry to the genre, and boasts very little to offer any audience, young or old. The film makers probably thought they were creating a sort of WIZARD OF OZ for today's generation. What they ended up with is a lot closer to ADULT MUTANT NINJA KANGAROOS.
