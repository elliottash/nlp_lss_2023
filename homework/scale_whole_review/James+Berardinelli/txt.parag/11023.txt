Watching THE WEDDING SINGER is like being force-fed an overdose of '80s culture and memorabilia coated with syrup. I realize that romantic comedies, by their nature, are supposed to be feel-good experiences, but THE WEDDING SINGER overdoes it in the schmaltz department. This movie is sickeningly sweet, and only a die-hard romantic or an avowed Adam Sandler fan will be able to sit through the ninety-five minute feature without going into sugar shock.
It wouldn't be so bad if the film was (a) funny, (b) well-written, (c) offbeat, or (d) heartfelt. THE WEDDING SINGER is none of these things; what's more, there are precious few moments of originality to ease the progression from 1-to-2-to-3 in the scripted-by-numbers screenplay. The only positive adjective I can come up with to describe the movie is "cute". As in terminally cute. This movie desperately wants to be liked. The problem is, there's not much here to like -- at least nothing that's new or interesting.
In general, I enjoy romantic comedies -- sometimes even those that feature recycled storylines. But THE WEDDING SINGER suffers from two fatal flaws. In the first place, it demands the kind of extreme suspension of disbelief that should never be required from this sort of movie. The plot is so outlandish and difficult-to-swallow that it's tough to endure all of the contrived obstacles that stand in the way of true love. Secondly, there's no palpable chemistry between the two leads. Yes, Adam Sandler is surprisingly effective as a likable romantic lead (instead of the wisecracking personae we're used to), and, yes, Drew Barrymore does a good job as the pretty girl-next-door. But there's no connection between their characters. Romantic tension, the most critical aspect of any love story, is absent.
Then there's the setting. Instead of just establishing that THE WEDDING SINGER takes place in 1985, the film makers are determined to cram the movie full of every '80s reference they can think of. It becomes oppressive. We get MIAMI VICE, MAGNUM P.I., DYNASTY, DALLAS, junk bonds, Donald & Ivana, the Rubick's Cube, mid-'80s fashion, and enough pop music to cause a flashback. It wouldn't be quite so irritating if there were fewer mistakes and anachronisms. CD players, like VCRs, were mainstream by 1985, but one reasonably hip character doesn't know what a CD is. There's a reference to J.R. being shot on DALLAS, but that happened back at the turn of the decade. Also, by 1985, the Rubick's cube was passé. The bombardment of '80s songs in THE WEDDING SINGER had me thinking that maybe '70s tunes weren't that bad, after all.
THE WEDDING SINGER's main characters (and eventually fated-to-be- together soul mates) are Robby (Sandler) and Julia (Barrymore). He's a wedding singer who loves his job crooning to newly-married couples because of his romantic nature. She's a waitress who meets him when they work a wedding together. Since both are otherwise engaged (literally), they form a platonic friendship. Then the complications start. Robby's fiancee, Linda (Angela Featherstone), leaves him at the altar, sending him into a tailspin. Meanwhile, Julia's beau, Glenn (Matthew Glave), finally sets the date. Julia goes to Robby for help in planning her wedding, figuring that his experience will prove invaluable (this strikes me as an incredibly insensitive thing to do). As the weeks pass, the attraction between them grows. Everyone, including Julia's sister (Christine Taylor, Marcia of THE BRADY BUNCH movies) and Robby's best friend (Allen Covert), notices it -- everyone, that is, except Robby and Julia. So, do they recognize the mutual attraction before Julia says "I do" to her cad of a fiancee? Does Robby's girlfriend, who suddenly wants him back, spoil things? It doesn't take a crystal ball to answer those questions.
Perhaps the most surprising element of THE WEDDING SINGER is how tame Sandler is. With the exception of a few momentary lapses, there's nothing to indicate that this is the same seemingly-hostile comic who made his mark in films like BILLY MADISON and HAPPY GILMORE. Too bad he hasn't chosen a better vehicle for displaying his range. Meanwhile, if you're in the mood for a movie with the word "wedding" in the title, stop by the video store and check out THE WEDDING BANQUET, MURIEL'S WEDDING, or MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING. All three are much better than this limp Valentine's Day farce.
