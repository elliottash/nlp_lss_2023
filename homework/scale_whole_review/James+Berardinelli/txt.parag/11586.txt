Reviewing a Jackie Chan film is a lot like reviewing a James Bond film – it's necessary to take the movie in the spirit it was intended, which means that, while familiar motion picture elements like plot and character development are necessary ingredients, they are not focal points. In fact, judging any Jackie Chan movie by stodgy and traditional criteria would result in a rather lackluster result. Fortunately, there are enough other elements (comedy and action in particular) to more than offset the uninspired storyline. Even at his worst, which MR. NICE GUY definitely isn't, Chan is fun to watch.
Ever since New Line Cinema released RUMBLE IN THE BRONX three years ago, Chan's popularity in the United States has been on the rise. RUMBLE was quickly followed by American theatrical rollouts of FIRST STRIKE, SUPERCOP, and OPERATION CONDOR. Currently, Chan's first major Hollywood feature, RUSH HOUR, is in production. Meanwhile, the changeover of Hong Kong from British to Chinese hands has done nothing to dampen Chan's popularity in Asia, where he remains the biggest star in the firmament.
MR. NICE GUY represents the next step in Chan's global conquest – his first all English-language picture. Originally slated to be filmed in New York City, the location was changed to Melbourne for financial and logistical reasons. The cast is comprised largely of non-Asian actors, including Western martial arts star Richard Norton, with whom Chan has worked twice before (TWINKLE TWINKLE LUCKY STARS, CITY HUNTER). The director, Samo Hung, has a long history with Chan, having directed him in seven previous pictures. In addition to taking the helm, Hung makes an appearance in front of the camera in a small-but-pivotal comic role as a cyclist who gets pushed too far.
As a change of pace, Chan doesn't play a policeman or secret agent this time. Instead, he's a popular TV chef named Jackie. Although fighting bad guys isn't his thing, he can't resist a damsel in distress, and, when a redheaded TV reporter, Diane (Gabrielle Fitzpatrick), is in need of help, Jackie's assistance causes him to be unwittingly pulled into a crime war that features drug dealers on one side and gang members on the other. Meanwhile, there's the matter of an incriminating video tape that Jackie has which everyone wants. To get it, they're willing to go to any lengths, including kidnapping Jackie's girlfriend, Miki (Miki Lee), breaking into his house, and terrorizing him at a public appearance.
There's more action and comedy in MR. NICE GUY than in the last few Chan films. Perhaps thankfully, considering how convoluted some of the storylines are, there's also less emphasis upon plot. This allows us to concentrate upon Chan's spell without being distracted by implausible and unnecessary narrative details. MR. NICE GUY gives us the basics: Chan at his action/comedy best, a bad guy (Norton) who enjoys chewing on the scenery, and three attractive women (Lee, Karen McLymont, and Fitzpatrick). Throw in about a half-dozen high energy martial arts fights, several impressive action/chase sequences, and a spectacular finale, and the recipe is complete. Who cares that there are some sizable storyline gaps or that one character, Diane, virtually disappears (without explanation) two-thirds of the way through the film?
MR. NICE GUY contains its share of memorable moments. The most dynamic of these involves Chan's attempts to avoid, then corral, a 120- ton mining vehicle which is subsequently used to wreak mass havoc (including trashing a $1.5 million house). There's also a fun chase with a runaway horse-and-carriage careening down Melbourne's Swanston Street. Finally, there's an amazing fight sequence that features Chan having close encounters with some power tools, including two circular saws. And for those who like unusual product placements, Pepsi gets one.
As usual, however, the centerpiece of MR. NICE GUY isn't all of the expertly-choreographed action sequences, but Chan himself. Unrestrained and charismatic, the international celebrity manages not only to smile his way through most of the film, but to cause audience members to do the same. The action is never too violent, and it's always tinged with comedy. Chan, whose mannerisms recall those of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin, pays tribute to the silent comics in a hilarious scene that involves a bunch of opening and closing blue doors. With its blend of crowd-pleasing elements, MR. NICE GUY is irrepressible fun.
