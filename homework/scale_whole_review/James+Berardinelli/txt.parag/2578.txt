I'm not sure of the definition of "sequelitis", since it isn't the sort of term that can be found in a dictionary. My best understanding is that it has something to do with the needless proliferation of unnecessary sequels. To be sure, some series (such as STAR TREK or INDIANA JONES) are perfectly suited for future installments. CITY SLICKERS, on the other hand, is a different matter. I believe that Billy Crystal and the people at Columbia Pictures, left in a vulnerable state by the thought of more money, caught the sequelitis bug.
The original CITY SLICKERS was a reasonably-entertaining, unassuming romp that crept into the theaters in the summer of 1991, and ended up becoming a highly-successful venture. CITY SLICKERS 2, on the other hand, is planned as one of this summer's big blockbusters, so anything less than a nine-figure gross is going to disappoint. However, while the first movie was of the hit-and-miss variety, this installment is all miss-and-miss.
Billy Crystal is back as Mitch Robbins, a man whose fortieth birthday has spawned a mini mid-life crisis. One night, while examining a hat that had once belonged to the late, lamented Curly, Mitch discovers what appears to be a treasure map (leading to $1 million in solid gold). After a trip to a library to verify the map's legitimacy, the "CITY SLICKERS" are off again into the wild west. This time, Mitch is joined by best friend Phil (Daniel Stern), brother Glen (Jon Lovitz), and Curly's long-lost twin, Duke (Jack Palance).
The only thing I'll give the production team credit for is that they didn't try to re-hash the first movie. Too many sequels are simply uninspired reworkings of the original material. CITY SLICKERS 2, however, does something new. The problem is that this "something" doesn't work.
Most discouraging is that the movie isn't especially funny. Oh, there are laughs to be had here and there, but nothing memorable. Considering that the comic talents of both Billy Crystal and Jon Lovitz are represented on screen, this is surprising. However, both men are restrained, which leaves the most humorous material to Daniel Stern. The result: as far as western comedies go, MAVERICK has this film trampled underfoot.
Speaking of MAVERICK, there are quite a few similarities between the Mel Gibson/Richard Donner flick and this one. Both have a runaway coach/wagon sequence, both feature a similar playful tone, both are nicely photographed, and both run on for too long. For me, the difference is that I walked out of MAVERICK satisfied, and out of CITY SLICKERS 2 disappointed.
Dramatically, this film is an amalgamation of bad cliches. None of the various bonding sequences have any sense of depth, and the characters have been reduced to caricatures. Everyone is still likable, but that's the only trait the main four can claim, and affability by itself is tantamount to being boring.
Movie references abound, although it's difficult to figure out why some of them are there in the first place. THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE stuff is self-evident, as in the INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM sequence, but THE GODFATHER?
The conclusion is sappier than usual for a Lowell Ganz/Babaloo Mandel film. These two have made a career out of happy endings, so it should come as no surprise that everything works out fine. The manner in which the various threads are tied together is enough to send even the most devout fan of this type of movie into sugar shock.
When money is involved, I no longer bother to ask why a particular film was made. It may be a bad idea, but so what?. Who cares that an inferior project like this cheapens the original? With this movie, there's a bankable star, previously-established characters, and a recognizable name. Given all that, who needs an interesting script?
Westerns and western comedies appear to be big this summer; hopefully, CITY SLICKERS 2 represents the least enjoyable of the bunch - otherwise, it's going to be a long wait until Labor Day.
