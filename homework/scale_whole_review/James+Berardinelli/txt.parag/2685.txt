Like last year's atrocious ROOKIE OF THE YEAR, LITTLE BIG LEAGUE is a boy's fantasy. At one time or another, almost every baseball lover dreams about what it would be like to take a turn at bat, manage from the dugout, or pull the string on a big trade from the front office. The unfortunate thing is that too often this sort of fantasy doesn't make a good drama--passable entertainment, perhaps, but there isn't enough meat for anything more solid
Personally, I prefer baseball movies flavored by nostalgia. Using real, current major league teams is problematic because it forces a fanciful film into the realm of reality--not a good place to be for something like LITTLE BIG LEAGUE. At least in this case, unlike in MAJOR LEAGUE 2, today's players aren't snubbed. There are plenty of cameos by big-leaguers, including American League All-Stars Ken Griffey Jr. and Randy Johnson.
The premise is relatively simple. Billy Heywood (Luke Edwards) is one of Minnesota's biggest baseball fans--and why not, since his grandfather (Jason Robards) owns the Twins. It comes as something of a surprise to everyone, however, when, after Granddad's death, the will reveals that the baseball team has been bequeathed to Billy. The eleven-year old takes his new role very seriously--so seriously, in fact, that when he fires the current manager, he decides to come down from the front office and manage the Twins himself. Predictably, the players are not enthralled about being ordered around by a kid, and they make their feelings known.
The most serious failing of LITTLE BIG LEAGUE is the screenplay. >From beginning to end, the movie feels painfully scripted. There is no sense of spontaneity, and none of the actors gives a strong enough performance to transcend this limitation. The first half of the motion picture is especially poor, as characters and situations are introduced in contrived fashion. Are we really expected to believe that no one at a little league game other than Billy knows that three men on one base means two outs?
The antiseptic clubhouse atmosphere is not representative of that of a real baseball team. Sure, there are the petty jealousies and ego trips, but none are presented in a convincing fashion. Without exception, the players are ciphers with cardboard personalities. The lack of salty language is as obvious as the lack of enthusiasm, and there's far too much culture and civility.
The interesting thread that flows through the film deals with how the pressure to win can quell the simple fun and enjoyment of playing the game. Billy starts out saying that all he wants is for everyone to enjoy themselves--don't worry about errors or wins; just give a good effort. However, before long, he has become part of the business--making personnel decisions based on who's more likely to get the game-winning hit. The smile and youthful enthusiasm are gone. Billy is neglecting his friends so he can do paperwork.
Unfortunately, the resolution of this situation is simplistic and disappointing. Like so much else in this motion picture, it feels phony--just another easy way out of a tough situation. Life, even on the baseball diamond, isn't like that, and for a movie with a lesson to teach, this sort of facile solution rings false. The enjoyable portions of LITTLE BIG LEAGUE can't camouflage the limited quality of the production.
The humor is low-key and occasionally effective. There is a running gag concerning the proliferation of statistics in the game. There's also an amusing incident where Billy's mother scolds him for using foul language in an argument with an umpire. Unfortunately, there are too few of these moments.
Modern-day baseball is a business. This is something that LITTLE BIG LEAGUE wants to ignore, to the detriment of its credibility. Even players who are on the field because of a love for the game don't act the way the members of Billy's team do. This film never believably captures the sport it portrays, and that leads to a picture that's closer to a strikeout than a home run.
