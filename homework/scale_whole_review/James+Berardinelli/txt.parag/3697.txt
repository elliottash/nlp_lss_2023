Like Hal Hartley's AMATEUR, COURAGE develops as a noir thriller while simultaneously spoofing the genre. This film has all the right elements: a dark, evocative atmosphere, double and triple-crosses, multi-million dollar scams, and an appealing heroine. It's a difficult task to pay homage to a film style while simultaneously parodying it. However, director Mario Camus establishes the perfect tone, leading to an entertaining romp through familiar-seeming territory that is subtly transformed by his lighthearted methods.
Played with unbridled energy and enthusiasm by helium-voiced Veronica Forque (from KIKA), Juana is placed in a desperate position when her husband Simon, a frequenter of Spain's high finance inner circles, disappears -- apparently with a lot of money. Everyone -- police, gangsters, and bankers -- wants something from Juana, but she knows nothing and refuses to lose faith in her beloved husband. Things change, however, when Juana discovers that Simon has a mistress. Suddenly, it's pay back time.
COURAGE displays a lot of offbeat humor as it toys with typical noir plot elements. The ending is such a masterpiece of timing and trickery that it may surprise even thriller veterans. Don't expect the traditional here -- Camus shuns anything remotely somber and his heroine is far from the usual femme fatale. The result is a film that never takes itself too seriously, and, consequently, is a whole lot of fun to watch.
