There is a yin to every yang, and if there is a down side to the remarkable success of Disney's recent animated features, it's that the Mouse keeps upping the ante for every subsequent feature. 1989's THE LITTLE MERMAID became the highest grossing animated release ever, as did 1991's BEAUTY AND THE BEAST and 1992's ALADDIN. Is THE LION KING ready to follow in those massive footsteps? Most likely. While not as emotional as BEAUTY or as fast-paced as ALADDIN, THE LION KING is genuinely entertaining, with moments of truly stunning visual creativity. Only weakness in the music and a fractured tone hamper the proceedings.
THE LION KING is the tale of Simba (voice of Jonathan Taylor Thomas), the son of Lion King Mufasa (James Earl Jones). The birth of the new heir displaces the king's brother Scar (Jeremy Irons), leading the envious Scar to plot the death of Mufasa and Simba. When Mufasa is killed while trying to save Simba, Scar convinces Simba he must go into exile. There Simba is befriended by meerkat Timon (Nathan Lane) and warthog Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella), and grows to adulthood (adult voice of Matthew Broderick) blissfully free of responsibilities. However, when childhood friend Nala (Moira Kelly) informs Simba that Scar is destroying the prideland, Simba must decide whether to keep his distance or to confront his demons ... and Scar.
Like the last three big Disney hits, THE LION KING is a musical, but it probably shouldn't have been. Elton John and ALADDIN lyricist Tim Rice have provided five new songs, but nothing has the sparkle of the Menken/Ashman compositions, and for the most part the production numbers seem more obligatory than inspired. "I Just Can't Wait to Be King" is a silly, gaudy bit, and "Hakuna Matata" is a recycled "Bare Necessities." The one exception is Scar's song, "Be Prepared," which Irons delivers with zest. It also features a chilling sequence with goose-stepping hyenas parading past Scar against a subtle background with images of swastikas. Hans Zimmer's Afro-tinged arrangements and incidental score make the most of the music, but THE LION KING is much more effective when the story is spoken rather than sung.
The story is a somber one, an animated "Hamlet" of sorts, and frequently the animation matches that tone. The elephant graveyard, populated by Scar's hyena cohorts (voices by Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin), is a spooky wonder, while the later appearance of Pride Rock is simply bleak. These sequences might be less than entrancing to the very young, but they are offset by lively, funny sequences featuring Timon and Pumbaa. Nathan Lane gives Timon a Bugs Bunny cockiness which is charming, and Ernie Sabella is equally endearing as the affably flatulent warthog. Nala's pursuit of Pumbaa is the film's comic highlight, but the action in THE LION KING tends to be more serious. Parents should exercise some judgment regarding taking children under six.
None of this is to suggest that THE LION KING plods along humorlessly. Timon and Pumbaa get the most to work with, but they are ably assisted by the other supporting characters. Scar, while sinister, gets of some dark one-liners; Robert Guillaume has a small but goofy bit as a Yoda-like baboon. The most entertaining vocal performance, however, comes from Rowan Atkinson (the malapropping minister from FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL). As Zasu, a hornbill who serves as Mufasa's chancellor and Simba's chaperone, he gets a fussy part that's a cross between THE LITTLE MERMAID's Sebastian and BEAUTY AND THE BEAST's Cogsworth, but Atkinson's droll delivery makes it his own (and provides the single biggest laugh with a shot at one of Disney's most annoying songs). THE LION KING is not a masterpiece; it is too slow at times, and has perhaps too many characters to juggle. Still, it is witty and beautifully drawn, and is sure to continue Disney's amazing animated winning streak.
