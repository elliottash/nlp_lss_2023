At first glance, there's every reason to believe John Cusack is the ideal cast for Rob Gordon, the protagonist of HIGH FIDELITY. A single, likeable, somewhat directionless guy in his early 30s, Rob spends his days hawking the archaic music format of vinyl in his shop Championship Vinyl, then spends his nights obsessing over his failed relationships. Throughout HIGH FIDELITY, Rob narrates his story directly to the audience, describing his troubles with his soon-to-be-latest-ex Laura (Iben Hjejle) and Laura's place in his catalog of break-up stories. Few actors could pull off the amount of narration required of Rob without becoming instantly annoying; even fewer could make self-absorption somewhat sympathetic.
So why does Cusack seem ever-so-slightly wrong in a role that should be so right? It's not the sharp comic setting crafted by director Stephen Frears and a team of four writers (adapting Nick Hornby's novel). That setting finds Rob and his co-workers Barry (Jack Black) and Dick (Todd Louiso) holding court in Championship Vinyl, mocking customers for their lack of musical acumen and exchanging Top Five lists of best songs in detailed categories (e.g., Top Five Side-One, Song-One Tracks). Cusack is fine as the saner center, but his co-stars are superb. Black's Barry is an aggressive, abrasive pedant who delights in the power of dispensing arcana or withholding a rare record; Louiso's Dick is a portrait in awed fan-geek deference. When the Championship crew is rattling off obscure band influences or rattling customers with their disdain, HIGH FIDELITY finds its highest energy.
It's not the focus on Rob's relationship history, either. Rob recounts his woman woes in search of a pattern to his failed love affairs, allowing for some great moments of comic humiliation (and a couple of priceless fantasy sequences). It also allows for a parade of familiar faces in extended cameos: Tim Robbins as Laura's other man; Lili Taylor as one needy ex; Catherine Zeta-Jones as another, more intimidating ex; even Bruce Springsteen pops up to offer advice. The gimmicky casting is occasionally distracting, but not so much so that it overwhelms the strengths of the individual episodes. There's even some charming wisdom in HIGH FIDELITY's acknowledgement that middle school make-out sessions can stay with you for life, or that a skillfully made mix tape can speak from the heart.
No, the one key problem with an otherwise thoroughly entertaining film is that Cusack's screen persona is just too ... nice. Rob is a somewhat unreliable narrator, since it is gradually revealed that he's caused just as much emotional damage as has been done to him. One breakup inspired by his own sexual frustration has morphed in his mind into the woman's fault; he acknowledges having cheated on Laura while they were together; he sleeps with a singer (Lisa Bonet) even as he's fuming over Laura's involvement with another man while they're separated. Combine his romantic irresponsibility with his musical snobbery, and you've got a character that should be played with more jerkish, immature edge. With Cusack, the nice guy is too dominant. Rob's confessions -- which should have played as calculated attempts to win us to his side -- feel more like guileless soul-baring coming from Cusack's mouth. And they never quite feel right.
In the end, Rob learns some valuable lessons and starts to grow up a little. It's only then that you can feel enthusiastic about wishing for Rob's happiness. HIGH FIDELITY's sharp wit could have made up for a multitude of sins, when in fact it only has to make up for one; there's more than enough quality film-making to weigh in the film's favor. There's also that nagging realiation that Rob's not the good-natured hero we all want him to be when John Cusack is playing the part. Cusack has proven himself to be a talented, versatile actor, but there's a guy we've come to know and love in off-beat romantic comedies like THE SURE THING, SAY ANYTHING and GROSSE POINTE BLANK, and it's hard not to listen to Cusack reveal personal traumas without expecting that guy. Even when HIGH FIDELITY is at its most inspired, you can tell that Rob Gordon isn't that guy.
