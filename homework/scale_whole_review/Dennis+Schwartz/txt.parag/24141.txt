A verbose talk-fest, which is a play more than a visual film experience, as adapted by Sidney Lumet from Ira Levin's Broadway play about a parlor murder game. Lumet as always, sucks any subtlety out of his films. Here he is in a bit of a frenzy in portraying the characters, relying more on plot twists than character development. In comparison with a similar-type of stage play put to the silver screen, Joseph L. Mankiewicz's Sleuth, Lumet's is clearly the inferior one.
The film centers around the Michael Caine character Sidney Bruhl, a once successful mystery playwright, who at the age of 46, has lost his ability to write. He is tired of living off his wealthy wife, Myra (Cannon), in their spacious and attractive East Hampton home. When his latest Broadway play flops, his fourth such disaster in a row, he returns home drunk and depressed, but tells his wife that a student in one of his writing seminars sent him a brilliant manuscript that he would kill for. At first, Myra thinks he is joking about killing for the play, but when he tells her this student, whom he doesn't even remember what he looks like, Clifford Anderson (Reeves), "has written a play that is so good, even a gifted director couldn't hurt it," and to make matters even better, he is a loner who has no other copies of the manuscript. She begins to think, maybe he isn't joking, that he actually might kill for a hit play.
The story builds in suspense when the cheery Clifford arrives in their house to go over the play with his former teacher and Sidney carries out his plan to kill him by trickily getting him to handcuff himself with his souvenir Houdini handcuffs and then strangling him with another prop from one of his plays. Myra tried to stop him, but could only helplessly scream, feeling repelled that her husband could do something like that but is unwilling to turn him over to the cops. At this point, the film had a fluidity and a macabre comical tone to it. But, it changes in a drastically different direction, and the surprises in the plot, from here on, come about faster than a Venice Beach skateboarder trying to impress the bystanders.
Removing Clifford's body, with his reluctant wife's help, the Bruhl's are about to retire for the night, when a nosy neighbor, Helga Ten Dorp (Worth), a visitor from Holland who is staying with the family next door, pays them a visit. She also happens to be a psychic and senses something is wrong in the house; she feels pain everywhere, especially in the study-area, where Sidney keeps his mementos from his other plays, which include guns, knives, and swords. The psychic clearly sees dangers ahead and warns the couple to leave the house, she is especially fearful about what will happen to Myra.
What eventually shines through, is how clever and manipulative the script is. I felt used by the characterizations, as it took away a lot of the pleasure derived from the snappy dialogue and the absurdity of the storyline, that in the first act, worked really well. Caine seemed marvelous at first, but I soon tired of his constantly frantic look. It was Dyan Cannon, with her sweet giggles and frustrated looks, who brought a needed restraint to the film, and as long as she was onscreen the film had an edge to it. Too many contrivances made everything seem so superficial, which is a shame, because the film did have its funny moments.
