This 1950s sci-fi/horror cult classic opens with a dead body found on the grounds of a secret experimental atomic test-site of a U.S. Air Force base located in the remote Winthrop-Manitoba part of Canada. The base is operated under the joint consent of Canada and the U.S., and is being used to experiment on long-range radar installation capabilities, using nuclear energy and beaming that power to boost the scanning range of the experimental planes. This stuff is all hush-hush.
There is growing resentment toward the base in the small backward town (can you blame them!), as the local residents are blaming the new base for the poor production of milk due to the noise from the passing jets disturbing the cows and they are scared of the rumors they hear about fallout from atomic radiation. The military calls these people ignorant and superstitious for not trusting them. Gee!
The attractive murder victim's sister, Barbara Griselle (Kim Parker), agrees with the town officials that an autopsy won't be necessary, but Major Jeff Cummings (Marshall Thompson), the base investigator, urges a more careful investigation of this murder. He notes the look of extreme horror on the dead man's face and surmises there is more to this death than meets the eye.
The viewer watches as invisible forces next attack a farmer's wife (Lala) and then the farmer (White), with each of them screaming, throwing their head back, and grabbing at their neck and the invisible force never letting go until the victims are dead. The local constable Gibbons (MacKenzie) is very hostile to the Air Force people investigating these crimes, he even has a fist fight with the major when he sees him over at Barbara's house (I think he's a little jealous), and refuses to co-operate in anyway. But the major finds out from the local doctor, Bradley (Madden), and the military doctor (Winfield), that all the victims had their brains sucked out of them as well as their spinal cords removed.
The major also learns that Barbara is doing secretarial work for a reclusive research professor, Walgate (Kynaston Reeves), and he notices in her possession a manuscript for a book on "thought control," which sparks his interest, thinking there might be a connection there to the recent murders. His interest is further increased by his meeting with the strange but amiable professor, as a fourth murder is committed. This time it is the mayor who gets his brains sucked out and spinal cord removed. And if that wasn't enough, Constable Gibbons on a search party in the woods for the killer, disappears and shows up later in state of shock, as he dies in the same manner as the others who were killed.
By this time the major and Barbara show a strong affection for each other, and a little romance is blooming without even a kiss or holding of hands taking place, though there is one scene where she comes out of the shower with just a towel on and you know that got the major's attention. Now this romance could be taken for a serious one. But the major is a busy man, so romance must take second place in this film. It seems that the major is the only one on the base who does any work. The security officer, Captain Chester (Kilburn), he's more into doing paperwork than fieldwork, and the colonel, Butler (Maxted), who is good at delegating all responsibility to the major, and is therefore left with a clear mind to make the big decisions, like ordering the major to get the killer before the locals really get mad and try to shut down the base. So, you see, the major is a very busy man.
The major begins his investigation for real by speaking to the professor without holding back that the he is under suspicion. He believes that the professor is involved with the murders, especially when he learns from his security officer, that the F.B.I. has a file on the professor doing psychic research with atomic power and one of the books he published is on cybernetics.
Lucky for the major, he borrowed Barbara's searchlight before going to the local cemetery, because when he sees someone fleeing the mayor's airtight mausoleum, he enters it and gets locked in there, and if weren't for Barbara knowing where to find him, the major would have perished that night.
It now becomes obvious that the professor is involved in this mystery, and the fun part of the film begins, or some might think the film really goes out of whack from here on. The prof comes clean and goes into detail how he created these invisible mutant creatures by tapping into the base's atomic power source and putting an electrical charge to his brain. He now urges the Air Force to destroy the nuclear plant, or else the invisible creatures can't be stopped. But things are not that simple, the atomic plant malfunctions and can't be shut down, and to my delight, the creatures become visible because of the increase in atomic power in the nuclear plant.
What's viewed on screen are brains with a spinal cord attacking everybody they see, killing all the people manning the nuclear plant. The colonel is tremendous in the crisis, he keeps popping these hopping brains with his .45 pistol and it turns out they are mortal, turning to mush when shot. There are great special effects, using stop-motion animation to show the brains moving around! Meanwhile, the colonel realizing the tight situation they are in, tells the major to single-handedly go into the nuclear plant and dynamite it. The major leaves before Barbara could talk him out of it. As some comfort, the security officer tells her, don't worry, if anyone could succeed in this impossible situation, it's Jeff. Luckily the genius professor runs out to act as a diversion for the hopping brains and gets devoured by three of them, giving Jeff a chance to complete his mission.
As entertainment value, this film should hit the right spot: it's a screamer. As anything greater, the story made little sense. This is just another mutant B- flick that is missing most of its brain. If the invisible creatures were supposed to bring with them an anti-atomic war message, the message was garbled and got lost somewhere along the way along with man's free will to resist the invisible creatures (who represent the forces in man that bring about war).
