Charlton Heston as Will Penny, gives, arguably, his best performance ever, in this magnificent Western on an aging cowboy, a loner, an illiterate, faced with the prospects of a dim future. He is someone who realizes that he can't do anything else but what he has been doing all his life, as he chooses to be a drifter rather than face the responsibilities of being with the one he loves. Written and directed by Tom Gries, who achieved critical but not commercial success with this demanding psychological character study on the hardships of a cowboy's lonely life, one of the most underrated Westerns ever made. He never made a film again of the same quality.
Will is working on the range to help bring a cattle herd to market. He sees the railroad tracks being laid on the prairie, indicating that time is running out for the cowboy way of life. Razzed by a young cowboy for being ancient, he refuses to fight back until the work is completed, not wanting to hurt his hands. When the cattle drive is over he has no trouble beating the younger cowboy. The boss, a fair man, Anse Howard (Costello), rewards him with a job to tide him over for the winter. But another cowboy gives him a hard luck story and Will gives him the job. He rides off with two other cowboys who think they might know of a place to pick up some work.
Seeing an elk in the woods, Blue (Lee Majors) and Dutchy (Zerbe) go to shoot it, but before they can fire, someone from across the river kills the elk. When they go retrieve it, a preacher, Quint (Pleasence) and his three sons, tell them that is their elk. The two sides shoot it out as Will joins his friends and kills one of the preacher's sons. The preacher then goes into a Biblical Old Testament rage about "An Eye for an Eye," promising to hunt down the killer. Penny calls these men "rawhiders."
Meanwhile, Dutchy, who is not handy with a gun, during the fight shoots himself in the gut and seems to be dying. The men try to find a doctor but to no avail. At the first town they come to, the saloon keeper tells them that he's a dead man for sure, the nearest doctor is too far away to reach in time, that they may as well stay here and have a few drinks. They leave Dutchy in the wagon and go have a few drinks. Also at this rest stop, is Catherine Allen (Hackett) and her young son Horace (Francis). They are going from their Ohio home to Oregon to meet her husband who went ahead of them to get the farm started. Her husband paid for a driver (Luster) to take them there.
They eventually get Dutchy to the doctor, who is the town barber. After spending the night in a hotel with a whore and taking a bath for the first time in months, Will rides off to the Flat Iron ranch to get work without waiting to see if Dutchy made it. He takes the place of the man he finds on the trail who probably died because his horse bucked. His job will be as a lineman for the big spread Montana ranch, where he will spend the winter in a shack and keep the cattle from straying and make sure no one squats on the land.
His first surprise is that he meets Catherine and her boy living in the shack he is supposed to live in. He tells them that the boss who hired him, Alex (Ben Johnson), told him there was to be no squatters, that he'll give them a week to leave before he returns from going around the spread to see where all the cattle are. But on the trail he is jumped by the psycho preacher and his subhuman sons, Rafe (Dern) and Rufus (Rutherford). All the rawhiders give over-the-top performances, with Pleasence's one being as maniacal as it gets. They severely knife Will and strip him of all his possessions leaving him there to die, but he somehow gets back to the shack and is nursed back to health by Catherine.
The cold and foreboding shack becomes a warm place, as the two gently fall for each other, without Will doing anything dishonorable. The chemistry between Heston and Hackett was magical. The cowboy attracted to her but respectful of her marital status, manages to find love in relating to her son and teaching him how to be a cowpoke. But it is all shattered during Christmas when the rawhiders come again to torture Will and now include Catherine and her son in their sick Biblical revenge.
After their rescue, Catherine renounces her husband and wants to live with Will. But in this somber ending, Will tells her he is almost fifty years old, he can't change his way of life, and the two part company.
The script captures the nuances and local flavor of the cowboy on the trail in an authentic and moving manner. The direction was superb; the lucid cinematography added to the splendor of the story. An elegant Western, exemplified by truly subtle performances by Heston and Hackett.
