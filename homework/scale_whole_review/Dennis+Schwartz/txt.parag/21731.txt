HANDS ON A HARD BODY(director: S.R. Bindler; cinematographers: Bindler/Michael Nickles/Chapin Wilson; 1997)
Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz
If you want a brand new $15,000 Hard Body blue Nissan pickup for free, you might consider entering a contest from an auto dealership in Longview, Texas, taking place every spring, where contestants are chosen from a lottery. In this filmed 1995 contest, where there were 24 contestants, the winner of the pickup will be the last one standing upright, no leaning or squatting allowed, with the winner having at least one gloved hand (the glove is to avoid any scratches) on the truck.
The other rules of the contest include a mandatory drug test when the contest gets down to three people. A second prize of $250 and a third prize of a gift certificate at a local store, to appease the contestants who have gone so far but failed. There are 5-minute breaks every hour and after 6- hours there is a 15-minute break.
The dealership's crude advertising gimmick, seemingly exploits the blue-collar type of participants undergoing this lunacy, who will go without sleep for days and will battle exhaustion, the heat, and the mosquitoes. This makes for a different type of documentary, one with a less serious tone than most others but one that is fun to watch, as the varied contestants of different ages, sizes, genders, and races, each have their idea on what it takes for them to win. The thing they have most in common, is that they want the truck, the question is how much do they want it.
A previous winner, the cowboy sage, Benny Perkins, who went for some 80+ hours without sleep to win his truck two- years ago, offers his view on what it takes to win this endurance test in an interview shot before the contest began and was shown throughout the contest, of which he was again an entrant, and was considered the favorite because of his previous experience. He contends that it is mental toughness that is required and maturity, and knowing how to get comfotable and eat light food during the breaks. He doubts if anyone under 30 will win, unless he is a former marine with that disciplined mind-set. He calls this event a human drama thing, rather than a contest.
Bindler's camera crew was there night and day to chronicle the event, along with voluntary judges and family and friends cheering on the contestants, as the documentary became about why and how the participants entered the contest and why they are still in it. Bindler is a native of that Texas city, though the 29-year-old went away to study at New York University film school, but returned to film the event he recalled as something he thought was absurd but didn't know what else to make of it.
Some of the contestants who were singled out for interviews, were the one's whose personalities stood out, whom we saw at different hours and in different frames of mood and in alternating physical conditions.
Norma is an obese Hispanic woman, who is a fervant Christian. She believes God wants her to win the truck and she has a prayer group of some two hundred members from her church praying for her to win. To keep alert, she listens to gospel music on her radio headphones and sometimes goes into fits of joyous laughter to keep her spirits up. Russell Welsh needs to get a truck to replace his other one after a tough year. Kelly Mangrum is an attractive student, who wants braces and will sell the truck to meet some of her other expenses. Greg is an ex-marine, who believes he has the youth and physical stamina to win. Janis is distinctively missing a few front teeth and says she always finishes what she starts. Ronald is a black country boy, who says he will fast for three days but is seen eating snickers during the breaks. He wishes there was no tent over his head because he loves the heat and he thinks the tent helps the others more than it does him. J.D. Drew is the oldest contestant and is an avid deer hunter, who described how he stood patiently for long periods to get his prey. Angie learns that she didn't prepare properly for the contest and quits when she becomes disorientated, saying she doesn't think she would ever do it again, but she comes back next year and wins. Paul Prince feels he is in great condition and thinks he can go the distance. Raul thinks he has what it takes to win and is seen getting a foot massage from his girlfriend.
What is magnanimous about the documentary, was that even though it could have gone for the cheap joke and made fun of these people, instead it takes them seriously and let's them explain in their own way why they are there. The filmmaker clearly saw that what the contestants were doing was fantastic and out of the ordinary already, so there was no need to embellish the story, and by keeping it simple, he succeeded in telling their story honestly and in a very human way. These real people happened to also be likable people, manifesting real concerns and problems, and when people start dropping out, you can see a camaraderie growing between some of these strangers (others remain critical of their competitors). But, despite the competitiveness of the event, most of them realize that they were all put through some ordeal, and they went through it together and therefore shared the trip and learned something about human values. The result is a quirky, non-dramatic, human interest story about the need for Texans to drive a pickup, as if it was their God given right to have one. And as Benny said, "It is something to see people struggling to get what you want. But, at least, they tried. People don't want to take a risk, anymore, they are afraid that if they fail, they will get hurt." I'll buy that. It's worth a look, reminding me a little bit of that Sydney Pollack film "They Shoot Horses, Don't They," but without the cheap sentimentality Pollack threw into his film. It played, for me, more like a sports story that ESPN 2 would air, where the filmmaker didn't know who was going to win and many times focused on those who unexpectedly dropped out, and part of the lure of the film was choosing who you think will win.
