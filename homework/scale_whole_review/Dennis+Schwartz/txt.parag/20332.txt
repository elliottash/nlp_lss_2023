Celebrity is like an amalgam of old Woody Allen materials, which has always given him an opening to concentrate on being witty and ignoring such filmmaking details as editing and plot. He seems to work well in chaos and in hyperboles. This fluff film (no pretense at Ingmar Bergman depths here) could have been funny but it isn't, except in brief spots. As far as being insightful about the "horses arses" who are into being celebrities without any other accomplishments to their credit, there's not really too much to be said that could be profound about that subject matter, it is obvious how shallow a fate just being a celebrity is. Woody makes a stronger statement in the film's subplot that deals with love, as he believes that meeting the right mate is mostly a matter of luck.
Here Kenneth Branagh is not Woody Allen, but he plays Woody and it doesn't work out that well. He's just not funny, all he's got down pat are Woody's voice inflections and neurotic gestures. It's as if he is a robot who looks the part but can't really be the part because he is isn't humanly programed that way. In this rambling celebrity hunt of a movie, where he plays a celebrity journalist working on a novel and on a film script, roaming the environs of NYC's Tribeca, Elaine's Restaurant, and the places of high fashion, he becomes the loser who keeps making bad decisions about his personal and career life.
Branagh is shown via flashbacks divorcing his nervous Catholic teacher wife (Judy Davis), without explaining why, as he stutters out his inarticulate response. As the film moves on we see that Branagh is a phony, using woman only to get ahead in his career. We first see this as he conducts an interview profiling the life of a famous actress (Melanie Griffith) in the house she lived in as a child. He romances her in the same bedroom she slept in as a child and audaciously tries to get her interested in his screenplay while he is in her arms romantically, saying he needs a star to be in the film for him to get his screenplay backed.
He is going out of his sexual mind when he meets the supermodel Charlize Theron, who shows him how she has orgasms when touched on any part of her body. She sexually dances with NBA basketball player Anthony Mason, and gives him her number in front of him. If Woody played that scene, it most probably would have been funny, but with Branaugh, it seemed pathetically flat and unfunny.
The only scene in the film that had a bit of spice in it that lasted for more than 15 seconds, was the Leonardo DiCaprio bit, where he's a famous bad-boy actor who Branagh tries to pitch his screenplay to in a hotel room, as he is beating up his girlfriend (Gretchen Mol) and trashing the room, all-the-while Branagh continues pushing his screenplay on him. They end up going to see a fight in Atlantic City, him borrowing $6,000 from Leonardo and losing that same money at the casino craps table, then going back to the hotel to party on some coke and participate in an orgy with a groupie who tells him she writes like Chekhov, all the time pitching unsuccessfully for his screenplay.
He steals Famke Janssen, who is a book editor, away from another, and has her move in with him as she helps him with his screenplay. But he meets again the very attractive and ambitious waitress/actress Winona Ryder that he was supposed to date in an earlier scene, and dumps Famke on the day she alters her entire life to move in with him. Meanwhile his ex-wife finds Mr. Perfect, a television producer, Joe Mantegna; she marries him, gets to be a popular TV host of a celebrity interview show, and has one hilarious scene where she goes privately to see a hooker (Bebe) guest on the celebrity TV show to learn the art of giving good head. The hooker asks her, "What she thinks about when she is giving a blow job?" and, she responds, "The Crucifixion." A banana is used as a prop for the sexual demonstration in self-improvement, until the expert chokes on it, and the demonstration comes to a halt.
Another funny bit took place in the green room of Famke's TV show, where waiting Klansman, an ACLU attorney, skinheads, a rabbi and a Mafia don discuss who is representing them from the William Morris Agency, as the rabbi's biggest concern is if there are any bagels left.
The film was reel-to-reel with celebrities, as they made their cameo and disappeared. Donald Trump is buying St. Patrick's Cathedral and tearing-it-down for a skyscraper. A producer says he is re-making Birth of a Nation with an all black cast. Famous for being in a coma, Sonny, Klaus Von Bulow's wife, lays in a coma but is wheeled out to appear on the celebrity TV show. Celebrities give trite comments to banal questions, such as, "What do you think of the rain?" Answer. "It's really something!"
The beautifully shot b/w film ends as it begins, as a plane passes overhead with the skywriting word "HELP!" This was a film that had no idea how to put this story together, it seemed so lifeless and flat, indeed, in need of HELP. For starters, none of the main characters were cast right, and especially Branaugh: there's no way, no matter how exact his mimicry of Woody is, that he can be thought of as a neurotic, nebbish, NYC Jew. What was needed was some originality and some energy into making the characters appear absurdly funny and not carbon copy imitations of how celebrities are. The few jokes in the film were far and few between, and could not overcome the tired feeling emanating from the rambling story. Woody is slipping, his last few films have been heading on a steady downward path.
