Mr. Cahn, in this AIP cheapie, provides some amusing hokum exploiting the occult-horror B-film genre in a very Hollywood type of way. The film's location is an unnamed beachfront community in Southern California, where both a skeptical police Lt. Ed James (Randell) and a square professor of psychic research Dr. Ted Erickson (Lance Fuller), are faced with unsolvable murders and the one they suspect is doing the killings is a mad occult-hypnotist Dr. Carlo Lombardi (Chester Morris). They aim to get the evidence to convict him of a series of bizarre murders by proving that he is a charlatan. Lombardi claims that the killer is a supernatural she-creature who comes to life from the beginning of time and comes out of the sea to commit murder. He gets visions of the creature who communicates with him and thereby can predict when the creature will appear. He has a beautiful assistant, a former carnival worker, Andrea (Marla), who hates him but is so possessed that she can't break free from the slave-hold he has on her. In his act, he puts her under hypnosis and she becomes a 17th century English woman.
The film opens with Lombardi staring furtively out to sea, conjuring up the creature. A set of larger than human footprints with seaweed appear on the sand; Lombardi follows them to a beach house. Inside the house, a couple has just been brutally killed. Lombardi is seen coming out of the house by Erickson and then walking casually along the shoreline. Dorothy's dog King is barking near the beach house and leads her and her boyfriend Erickson there. On the same beach, her parents, the wealthy Chappels are hosting a party, where Mrs Chappel (Freda Inescort) is being teased by her husband Timothy (Tom Conway), for believing in Lombardi's predictions and ability to communicate with the dead. Erickson is at the party as a guest of Dorothy.
Erickson is uncomfortable with her rich society connections and more comfortable with his academic scientist friends, who share the same smug beliefs as he does. He seems uncommitted to her outpouring of love. Instead, he falls in love with the very warm-hearted Andrea.
Meanwhile, Chappel, a businessman who will do anything to make a buck, offers Lombardi a fifty-fifty partnership in the occultist's act, with all expenses paid by him. Lombardi not only accepts, but moves into Chappel's luxurious home.
Chappel also tells Erickson that he can make plenty of money from Lombardi's fraud act by promoting his predictions and that he will give Erickson the money earned from the venture to help him get off to a good start when he marries his daughter. Erickson refuses to accept money that he considers to be dirty. He will become a vocal critic of Lombardi, trying to figure out his trick, and will work with the police to see how he manages to get the sea-creature to commit these murders, and try to find out if there is such a thing as this creature. It was rather comical to hear, that one of Erickson's harshest criticisms of Lombardi is, "He is putting hypnotism back twenty years."
When a local carnival barker (Paul Dubov) who once employed Andrea and is still concerned for her safety, is found murdered in his apartment in a supernatural way, after expressing concern to Lombardi about how deep he puts her under hypnosis, the police arrest Lombardi, but Chappel sends his lawyer to bail him out.
The act has so far earned them $250,000 a piece. The profits pour in: from a best-selling book written by Lombardi about Andrea, who while in hypnosis discovers that she is a reincarnation of a 17th century English woman; from his syndicated columns in newspapers around the country; and, from performing the popular act on stage, where he predicts when the monster will strike again.
Paul Blaisdell is the monster in a chintzy rubber suit-which covers a busty composite of scales, claws and tusks.
The viewer gets to see Lombardi put Andrea under at gatherings in the Chappel house, where there is smoke coming from her or into her whenever there is an exchange of souls. The Cahn way of filming these seances is more funny than scary.
The final scene, where Lombardi realizes that the only thing that can break Andrea's hold he has on her, comes from her strong love for Erickson, as he decides to use his powers for the evil purpose of killing his enemy Erickson. He possesses the dog's soul and King starts to attack the professor but is ordered not to by Andrea. Lombardi then puts Andrea under in Chappel's house gathering and the prehistoric sea-creature comes out of the sea again, as the police try to burn him and finally stop it with high-powered rifles.
This is strictly lightweight nonsense, which should be good for a few laughs. It is perfect viewing as a Saturday matinee. I can't see anyone taking this one seriously. The film ends in a mock serious tone, with Erickson gazing out at the sea and telling Andrea (her spell was finally broken) in a humble low voice, perhaps it was not meant for us to know the dark secrets from the past.
