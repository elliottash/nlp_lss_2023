An action-packed sleazy crime drama that pits a sadistic crime lord, Mr. Brown (Conte), against a police lieutenant, Leonard Diamond (Wilde), who is obsessed to smash Brown's crime syndicate. This film noir features a perverse sexual relationship between gangster Brown and a thrill-seeking society girl, Susan Lowell (Wallace), who stays with him for four years even though he treats her as a possession and she knows he's a ruthless killer. She can't leave him, as he knows what buttons to push to make her body quake for him. There is a sense of doom that all the main characters share, as they also share a sense of mixing violence with sex. There are no healthy relationships shown, as the good guy cop is fighting his dark repressions inside as well as the dark world of the gangsters. John Alton's photography, in a stark black and white tint, helps explore this ominous dark world of dangerous alleys and stylish penthouses.
Unable to get out of the deadly relationship with Mob financier Brown, as he has her followed everywhere by hitmen Fante (Van Cleef) and Mingo (Holliman), she tries to commit suicide by taking too many pills. When unconscious in the hospital, Susan called out the name Alicia. This is the lead that Diamond has been waiting for to nail Brown, as he tries to convince his superior, Captain Peterson (Middleton), to keep him on the case. The captain is finding it difficult to justify the expenses of investigating suspected Mob boss Mr. Brown for such a long time without any results. As a desperate measure Diamond arrests Brown and over ninety of his gang members, as he only asks them who Alicia is. Diamond is rewarded for his effort by getting the name Bettini (de Corsia) from Brown's lie detector test. Bettini, when tracked down and expecting to die by one of Brown's contract killers, will tell Diamond that Alicia was Brown's wife.
But Diamond gets the ire of Brown after all those arrests, and he gets Fante and Mingo to bring the meddlesome cop to a dark room where he tortures him. They use the hearing aid of second banana hood McClure (Donlevy), to bring up the volume beyond tolerant levels.
When they are finished with the cop, they pour hair tonic down his throat so that he appears drunk and they dump him on the doorstep of Captain Peterson. This torture session only makes Diamond more obsessed with getting Brown, as he follows up the lead Bettini gives him and sees the former skipper, a Swede called Dreyer (Hoyt), of the boat that Alicia, Grazzi, and Brown chartered when they were last seen. Dreyer now owns an antique shop thanks to Brown.
Thinking Alicia was killed, Diamond soon learns through the help of Susan that Alicia is alive. By decifering the clues in the recent photo of Alicia that Susan gives him, as she steals it from Brown's vault, he figures out she's in a private sanitarium. He also figures out that it was Grazzi who was killed on that boat and not Alicia, and he now goes after Brown with a renewed vigor.
But McClure also knows that Grazzi is dead and that Diamond knows this. He is jealous that Brown heads the syndicate instead of him and sees his big chance to head the syndicate by getting the hitmen to go along with him and double-cross the boss. Instead, he's killed by them. As an odd touch to his execution, Brown out of mock compassion removes his hearing aid so he won't hear the bullets.
Warning: spoiler to follow in next paragraph.
At last, Diamond gets Alicia to spill the beans about Brown killing his crime boss and dumping his body overboard, and of his placing her in the insane asylum to shut her up. When he tries to escape, Diamond traps him inside an airplane hangar as Susan shines the high beam lights on him.
Lewis has created a nasty film noir, where all the characters are sullied by their peculiar sexual habits. The sadistic hitmen Fante and Mingo, give all indications that they are in a fatalistic homosexual relationship that is heightened by their need for violence as a stimulant. The hero, Diamond, seems to be so compulsively motivated by his strong actions against Brown, because he's repressed and is secretly envious of Brown for attracting such a desirable woman. While Brown is a classical Freudian example of a nobody who dominates others by keeping them down. He's a former prison guard, who hides behind his insecurities by using his blinding hatred and insatiable sex drive and controlling nature to keep others in their place. His thing is to make everyone call him Mr. Brown and look up to him. He insults the cop by saying he gets the same wages as a busboy in one of the hotels he owns.
Conte is convincing as the maniacal hood, while Wilde is a good counter-balance to Conte. He stylishly plays his persistent cop role with a sense of reckless grit, as each becomes the other's alter ego. The film was raw, a visually unblemished drama about violence and pain.
