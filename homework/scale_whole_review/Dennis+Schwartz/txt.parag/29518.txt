Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz
Another Red scare propaganda film from the 1950s that is hideous. It's only saving grace is that it is well-crafted through the skills of director Jacques Tourneur. Otherwise the film is largely a bore, saddled with endless speeches from the main characters and an outdated paranoic viewpoint. It also suffers from a ludicrous ending on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, where the Commie racketeers get their just desserts in a ridiculously contrived setting.
Captain Alan Eaton (Dana Andrews) has been brainwashed during the Korean War as a POW in the hands of the Chinese Communists. He still suffers occasional headaches and dizzy spells, but the Army doctor (Dennis Moore) thinks it's best for him to go home to California to recuperate further. He tells the doctor his partner in the Washington, D.C., PR firm they run together has carried the business load since he's been in the service and he will ask him to carry the load for a few more months.
He heads to Washington to see his partner Clark Baker and meets on the plane a Dr. Jessup, who mentions he's a scientist against the nuclear arms race (in this film that means he's a bad guy). He gives the captain a friend's place to stay in case he can't get a hotel room.
Eaton is surprised to learn that the PR firm that is still named the same, has been taken over by Jim McGinnis (Foran). He is told by the surly McGinnis, that his partner, whom he gave power of attorney to, has sold the business to him and the next day was killed by a hit and run driver. Eaton smells something fishy, but when he checks the contract he finds that his partner's signature is on it.
He contacts his former client and old-friend Senator Walder and learns that the senator suspects McGinnis of running a racket through falsifying the polling results, thereby favoring certain clients to look good while others are ruined. This is in violation of the public interest, as the firm is supporting Commie influenced groups that are trying to undermine the American government. The senator suspects him of being a paid agent of the Commies, and he wants Eaton to take the consultant job that McGinnis offered and be an insider in that firm to get the needed evidence. He introduces him to a newspaper reporter who covered his partner's death and suspects he was murdered, Rodney Hillyer (Marston).
When Eaton can't get a room, he stops at the home Jessup gave him. He stays with a lout who is drunk, Harold Loder (Thordsen), and his wife Vivian (Veda Ann Borg), whom he catches going through his Army uniform pockets looking for a letter from his partner. He has to beat the lout up to get out of the house. He will later learn that Vivian is an expert forger and that Jesup and Harold were the eye witnesses to the hit and run.
Back at the office, he asks the flunky who works at the office, the chief statistician, Barney Bond (Mel Torme-the singer known as the Velvet Fog), about the Fletcher account. He's a lobbyist on the Hill, and the senator tipped him off that there's something shady going on about that account. He tries to get Barney to help him get a master's list of who is being polled, but when he tries to pump Barney he realizes he's in with the crooks. So he therefore gets the firm's secretary, Lorraine Dennis (Earle), to help. Naturally they become romantically inclined 1950s style, so we see no physical contact between them. But they do make eye contact, and she steals McGinnis' file cabinet key to give to him. He uses the key to get all the evidence he needs that he's dealing with Commies and crooks.
The finale is not suspenseful, surprising, or even interesting. But it looks good in black and white photography, and all the actors are so earnest in their roles that it makes one pause before raining on their parade. It's too bad that such a horrible script fills the screen with a witch-hunt theme that gives off a false patriotism message. This film can make you see Red!
