He idolized Fellini, who he wrote for and who gave him a chance to shoot a film for the first time, but which was not accepted by Fellini as a good enough work for him to use. The result was that Pasolini left Fellini and made his directorial debut in a film which covered the seamy side of life in Rome, Accattone (1961). It was different in style than other films at the time and was received very well by the critics. He concentrated on films during this period, as The Gospel According to St. Matthew (1964) exemplifies the mystic character in the simple faces of those involved with the preacher Christ, as he politically rails against an unjust society that condones waste and corruption. His Christ even curses those thieves of the people. For Pasolini's Christ, sin is only a crime against daily servitude. Oedipus Rex (1967) was the film that was closest to his upbringing, where the hero slays his father and sleeps with his mother. That is destiny and it can't be changed, the myth, which Pasolini believed, that so forcefully concurs with his own beliefs. The film turned out to be visually satisfying to audiences, though not pleasing all the critics. The last film he made, was his most controversial and decadent, Salo (1975). Here he decides to tell the truth as it is--not as he imagines it is. He relates the consumer culture with its intent being to keep selling their product, comparing it with Hitler's need to collect human bodies. Through all kinds of sexual debasements and perversities that are shown in this poorly received film, Pasolini attempted to make his point about current Italian society being like fascism. That he should die so violent a death, did not surprise everyone, especially since he led such a non-conformist existence, one where violence always seemed to be a part of his life, even though, he was not a violent person himself.
The 17-year-old, Pelosi, the accused murderer, was sentenced to 9-years in jail as a youthful offender, and the Italian press had a field day vilifying Pasolini for his moral decadence, almost saying that it was his fault, his homosexuality caused the crime. Pasolini, the decadent anti-fascist, pro-Communist, homosexual artist is a key figure in trying to come to grips with modern Italy and its many passions, this documentary provides some useful fodder about him, whether you are a novice to him or have followed his career fully. Interestingly enough, he was working on a book about some kind of modern Paul coming to America to sell his religious beliefs, before his brutal murder.
One thing I can say for sure about Pasolini, is that he is always interesting, even if he isn't always understood. This documentary gives one a good quick-look at him and should encourage those who are so inclined, to check-out his films or books, if they haven't done so before.
