"Dreaming of Joseph Lees" is a tedious romantic melodrama, set in Somerset, England, in 1958. The film was shot on the rugged, isolated terrain of the Isle of Man, which added to the film's bleakness. This drawn-out tragic love story manages to get at the characters it highlights, though what it uncovers is more obvious than startling or insightful. The somber story itself fails to be engrossing, though there is one marvelous scene of Rupert Graves, the one Samantha Morton pines for, visiting her heartless father's household for tea, while her family and the boyfriend she is living with is present. It was a thoroughly uncomfortable but poignant scene, shot in mostly brown and yellow coloring.
Eva (Samantha Morton) is a prim, reticent girl of twenty, who works dutifully as a clerk at the sawmill and does the household chores for her crabby father (Finlay) and precocious younger sister (Richardson). The bookish Eva fell in love with her second cousin, Joseph Lees (Graves), a geologist, when she was 14 and secretly pines for him ever since, even though she hasn't seen him since he lost his leg in a quarry accident in Italy.
She learns that he will be at her cousin's wedding, but somehow she moved in with a boy she doesn't love, Harry (Ross). He is the opposite of what she is seeking, being a dim-witted, clinging type, who is a pig farmer. He is without regard for culture or books. But he is obsessed with her, piquing her sexual curiosity, becoming hysterically despondent without her. She refuses to marry him but lives with him while secretly resenting him and dreaming of Joseph.
Having met Joseph at the wedding, she realizes she can't be with Harry anymore and uses the excuse to leave him when she discovers he had a one night stand with another girl. Harry goes on a potential suicide trip to woo her back, playing on her guilt and her good nature in helping others, while Joseph shows he's the refined gentleman who can warm her heart by saying nice things and turning her on to art books.
The script provides no plausible explanation for all the confusion going on in her head. One is therefore hard-pressed to figure out why she's with Harry when Joseph is there for her. It seemed to be a no-brainer which one to choose.
Everything is so bleak and weary, even the love scenes seemed exasperating, as it was hard to make heads or tails about what the poor girl was so befuddled about, though befuddled she and her two lovers were. When she goes back to Harry, it is Joseph's turn to cry out that he needs her. Harry will then walk the ledge of his roof for her love, threatening suicide, and Joseph will be willing to cut her all the slack she wants before she makes up her mind. By the time she resolved things, I was bored to death. It was obvious from the get-go that Harry wasn't for her, therefore the film lacked tension in her choice of who to be with. This film reminded me of a Thomas Hardy type of novel that was written by someone who didn't have the writer's obvious talents and has come up with a story that mostly captures the stark atmosphere of the rural community but does not put a proper perspective on the psychology of the characters.
