My Life as a Dog is an endearing kidpic from Sweden about a 12-year-old, Ingemar (Anton Glavelius), who cutely grows on you with his devilish antics, whether flashing his curiously innocent eyes at a would-be girlfriend or dressed to the nines in a bow tie and white shirt or getting a bottle unstuck from his private parts in a failed lesson on sex education he was participating in. This is a coming-of-age film, that plays as bittersweet melodramatics. It is enlivened by how lovable Ingemar is, as he learns about life by evaluating the big events in the world and then comparing it with his own life. He is much concerned about the Soviet dog Laika being sent up in space to die for a mission the dog had no choice in undertaking and compares that event with his own pet dog who is taken from him when he is uprooted to live in the country. It's a pleasant little film, with its small aims hitting its target repeatedly, quietly reflecting the joys and sorrows the youngster must go through in order to grow up, and how the bland 1950s and its omens of the future in space travel, new pop-up toasters, and a TV in every house, influence the youngster's life.
The picture follows this intelligent child around to see the world that he sees, as he is growing up in a single-parent home. His father is not heard from, being somewhere in the tropics working on a banana boat, his mother is very sick and dying from TB, and his older brother Erik is always fighting with him. Together they get on their mother's nerves, until she can't bear it anymore. Finally their mother gets so sick that she can't look after them and they are both sent away for the summer to live with different relatives in the country. The biggest disappointment for Ingemar is that he can't take his dog with him, it supposedly was brought to a shelter but he will never see it again. The title of the film is derived from his comparison of the fates of the Soviet dog with his dog, whereby both their lives are sacrificed without their consent.
His guardians are Uncle Gunnar (Tomas von Bromssen) and Aunt Ulla (Kicki Rundgren), who are simple country bumpkins, unable to talk about anything worldly but love to make small talk about the weather. He soon warms up to them and gets accepted into their small town, where the uncle works in the glass factory and is fanatical about soccer, being a player himself on the local team and the coach of the boys' school soccer team. The uncle also likes to observe the coconuts on the young ladies in town. By being very easy to talk to, with no pretenses, he thereby develops a warm and natural relationship with the youngster and makes his summer experience a joyous one.
One of Ingemar's duties, is to go to the apartment downstairs to see if the elderly Mr. Arvidsson (Didrik Gustavsson), who is infirmed to his bed, is doing okay.The old man gets his jollies from having Ingemar read aloud to him the women' underwear catalogues, which he keeps hidden under his bed from his wife.
Ingemar's summer tales involve meeting a tomboy called Saga (Melinda Kinnaman), who boxes with him, dresses like a boy to play soccer on their team, gets him to tape her growing breasts so that they won't be noticeable, and she also yearns to have him as a boyfriend. He makes friends with a youngster who has green-colored hair and whose father builds a spacecraft that the children ride in until it crashes; he acts as a bodyguard for a well-endowed glassworker, who is posing nude for a statue of the Virgin Mother. He falls comically through the skylight of the roof as he tries to get a better view of her; he meets some of the other odd characters in town, such as the trapeze artist who can remember all the U.S. presidents, even after he falls. He really has fun as he sits in the fun house his uncle is building, talking about life with his surrogate-father role model, as he is being initiated, as the poet Robert Bly says is necessary to do, into the male world.
Happy to be back home at the end of the summer and wanting to tell his mother everything he did, until he sadly finds that she has to be hospitalized. She soon dies before he can tell her what he did during the summer and give her his birthday gift, a pop-up toaster. He is then forced to return during the winter to live with his uncle again. But things are little different now. He learns again about death, as Mr. Arvidsson died. He also must now sleep in Mrs. Arvidsson new apartment because his uncle tells him there is not enough space in theirs and that it would be good for him to keep her company. But he finds much needed affection from Saga, who is behaving more like a young girl smitten by love and less like a tomboy.
Director Halstrom has a nice touch in working with the youngster, whose relationship with his uncle is priceless. The film is charming, it is sad, it is true-to-life, and never maudlin or sugary. It's a good nostalgia film for all those yearning to look back at their childhood, even if it be only vicariously through Ingemar. I fell for the film without being swept off my feet by it. The message underlying Ingemar's experience, is that life holds so much suffering in it, that one might as well get a few laughs out of it while one can.
The scenes of the snow on the TV screen while all the neighbors are brought in to watch a movie, the radio broadcast of the Swedish boxer Ingemar Johansson landing a lucky punch and knocking out the American champ Floyd Patterson, and the challenging games kids play to compete against each other, all brought back to me bittersweet memories of the 1950s.
