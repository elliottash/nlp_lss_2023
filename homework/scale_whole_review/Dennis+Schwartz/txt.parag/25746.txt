This silent film from 1925 is based on a true story as reported in the Hearst newspapers by Adela Rogers St. John. It was produced by Dorothy Davenport, who liked to call herself Mrs. Wallace Reid. Her husband, Wallace, was a big silent screen star, but died two years before the film from his morphine addiction. He developed the drug habit after an accident while filming and having that drug prescribed to him. The screenplay was written by Dorothy Azner, who made it into a statement film about women being abused in a male-dominated society.
The film starts out in New Orleans and tells about the lack of love in Gabrielle Darley's (Priscilla Bonner) house, where she was a young lady. Not knowing what love is, she fell for a man called Howard Blaine (Carl Miller), who told her he loved her and then put her to work for him in a whorehouse. After promising to marry her, she one day finds herself abandoned by him, and is comforted by her best friend Clara.
She goes to Los Angeles and while looking into a jewelry store, she spots Howard buying a wedding ring. Something snaps inside her when confronting Howard, as she will state in court -- "When I saw him buying the wedding ring...with the money I earned..." She then shoots him and when he is lying dead on the floor she becomes hysterical, yelling out, "Howard--forgive me--I love you."
At the trial, she tells her story and of her years in bondage to Howard. The sympathetic jury comes in with a not guilty verdict. Now she only wants redemption and to work off her guilt and do service to others to help restore her good name. A leading social figure and philanthropist, Mrs. Fontaine (Virginia Pearson), takes her home as a guest and gets notoriety in the papers about her good deed of helping out the unfortunate one. Mrs. Fontaine's chauffeur, Fred (Theodore Von Eltz), falls in love with her and they shyly act friendly to one another. But when Mrs. Fontaine gets all the publicity out of her that she could get, she gives her a letter of recommendation to the County Hospital to become a nurse and asks her to leave the residence. The hospital director recognizes her from the trial and refuses to hire her, so she wanders the streets of Los Angeles where she can't find work. Fred, meanwhile, had to take Mrs. Fontaine to Sacramento for a month and so she couldn't have his support.
The movie is an unbearable tearjerker, as Gabrielle is forced to return to New Orleans to get help and meets with one misfortune after another. Fred, when he learns that she went there, gets fired from his job, after giving some lip to Mrs. Fontaine for being such a phony. Unfortunately, before Fred could reach her in New Orleans, Gabrielle was being sexually attacked in the street by a burly man and when she ran from him, she got hit by a car and is taken to the hospital for a prolonged stay. Fred tries the address she should have been staying at, but finds out she never showed up there and no one knows where she is. Why she didn't tell her friends via note where she was, is beyond me.
At the hospital, when she recovers, America just entered World War 1 and the hospital is in desperate need for helpers. She becomes a cleaning woman, and one day Fred comes into the hospital in an Army uniform and they meet again. In a melodramatic scene, they embrace and he asks her to marry him, telling her in a few minutes he is shipping out to the front. She tells him that she wants to wait until after the war.
As an upshot of this true story, after the picture became very popular, the real Gabrielle Darley got upset that her name was once again public knowledge, as she wanted to forget the past and live with the good name she has since achieved. She takes Mrs. Wallace Reid, the producer, to court, and wins her law suit for infringement of her rights, and as payment she gets the luxury house Mrs. Reid's husband left her.
The film itself was unconvincing and too banal to strike a chord with me. It therefore doesn't surprise me, that, perhaps, Gabrielle wasn't as nice a person as portrayed in the film. This film is worth a look only for historical reasons, to see how melodrama was done before there were talkies.
