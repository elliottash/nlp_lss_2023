This psychological thriller is based on John Hopkin's play "This Story of Yours." This is a brilliantly acted picture, especially the performances of both Sean Connery as the veteran policeman but the now emotionally tortured inquisitor, Sgt. Johnson, and the perverse character Ian Bannen plays, as Kenneth Baxter, who is brought in for questioning by the police as a suspect during a child-molestation investigation.
The film was in some ways spoiled but not ruined by the pretentiously arty way it was directed. It framed its shots in an exaggerated arty manner, which took away from the subtlety of the unfolding story. There was also one glaring weakness, since the girl victim was still alive, the questioning should have been halted till she was well enough to identify the suspect, since it was disclosed that she was in the hospital but would definetly recover from the attack. This would have prevented the brutality resulting from the questioning.
There are puffy white bulls eyes exhibited around Johnson's head everytime the burned-out cop is having visions of what the perverted rapist had been doing to the 12-year-old girl he attacked, as he gets increasingly incensed while questioning Baxter. He identifies so much with what the perp is thinking, that he can just look at him and know if he did the crime or not. That Baxter and Johnson are of the same mind and know how to inflict hurt on each other, becomes the theme of the film, as Johnson is seen changing places with Baxter during the course of events.
The film opens in the police station, where Johnson is going berserk and then is restraint by the other police in the station. The story then goes into a flashback and we see Sgt. Johnson stationed by an elementary school, watching all the children getting picked up by their parents, since there has been three recent cases of child rapes in the area.
We see the rapist wait in the car near the school and follow a girl who is alone, Janie Edwards, across the commons and attack her in a muddy area. When the girl is reported missing the police search the area and Johnson discovers her cowering in the mud, in a state of shock. He is badly taken aback when he sees her in this condition, boiling over with anger, imagining what the rapist did to her.
The police who are checking out everyone who looks suspicious, bring in Kenneth Baxter, who is covered with mud and is seen walking around in the downtown area. At the stationhouse they can't wait to grill him and begin the questioning despite not given the word to do so by their boss. The audience knows that he is guilty because we saw him at the scene of the crime. Johnson knows he's guilty by just looking into his eyes. The police who question him can't get him to say anything but learn that he is a married man with two teenage daughters and is considered a respected member of the community. The police boss arrives at the stationhouse and the police halt their questioning, as the boss wants some evidence presented before holding him on any charges.
But Johnson has become obsessed with this case, more than any of the others he has worked on in his 20 years on the force, as he sneaks back into the room the suspect is being held and relieves the guard from the room. Baxter senses that Johnson knows he did it and fears him. During the course of this unauthorized interrogation, the things inside their two heads will come out in the open. Johnson says that this type only respects pain and that he has been smugly laughing at the other officers questioning him. In this claustrophobic holding-room, Johnson bullies Baxter, while Baxter sneers at him in a mocking tone. When Johnson snaps, he begins to punch Baxter around the room, which brings the film back to the beginning of the flashback, when the other police in the station come in to stop him. Johnson is put on suspension and told to remain home for the night. Ironically, Baxter is rushed to the same hospital the girl is in.
At Johnson's home, we see how unhappily married he is and how his life seems empty and unfulfilled, as he gets into a long brewing spat with his wife (Merchant). The dynamics between the two is powerful and stinging to both psyches, as the two can't commute to each other, there is nothing left in their marriage. In the middle of their argument the police come by to inform him that Baxter died. He is brought down to the station and the tables are turned on him, he is now being questioned by a superior officer from headquarters (Trevor), and is being bullied in the same way he has done to countless suspects.
The film remains fascinating, aided by impeccable performances and a dialogue that has some bite in it. The film might appear too stagy for some, but I found it an absorbing experience. It held my interest throughout.
