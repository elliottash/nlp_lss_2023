Filmed in 16mm just after Jim Jarmusch left film school, it's a rambling, visually gripping dream piece, that plays like an odyssey of urban despair, about a street person named Allie Parker (Chris Parker) and his growing isolation as a member of the lost post-punk generation. It tells about a few days in his life and of his odd lifestyle. It's set on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, with its abandoned buildings and shabby tenements, which gives it the look of a war-torn city. Allie is an alienated young man, who's mother is in a mental institution and he doesn't seem that sane himself. Though, he prefers to call his existence as being a reckless one, where he moves around a great deal living with strangers.
After walking the streets for a few days because he can't sleep, he returns to his girlfriend Leila's (Gastil) apartment and talks to the sullen girl. Even this relationship appears strained, as she remains quiet just looking out the window of her nearly bare tenement apartment. He tells her his hero is Charlie Parker, whose motto was: Live fast and die young. He proudly notes, that when Parker died he was buried in a three-piece white suit. His plans are to visit the building where he was born, which he says has been bombed because of the war. When Leila asks: Which war? He responds: the Chinese did it. He next plans to visit his mother in the insane asylum, as he hasn't seen her in a year.
At the building site where he was raised, he meets a mentally deranged transient living in an abandoned building, who thinks the planes flying overhead are enemy planes and he has to take shelter because they are dropping bombs.
His visit with mom, is equally as unproductive. She's as loopy as one can be.
The film was mainly shot outdoors, and shows Allie wandering the streets of Manhattan and meeting an assortment of strange characters. On the street, John Lurie (a member of the Lounge Lizards and along with the director, is the musical arranger for the film) plays a mean sax solo. He enters the lobby of the St. Marks Cinema, one of the great old movie houses, where Nicholas Ray's "The Savage Innocents" is playing. The popcorn girl pays no attention to him and continues reading her pocket book while he stands at the counter; but, when he orders popcorn and asks if the film is worth seeing, she says she only remembers the part where if an Eskimo has a baby boy they rub blubber over him and wish him luck. If it's a girl, they put snow in her mouth and slay her.
The funniest scene, is when he robs a car from a ditzy girl who goes to mail a letter and leaves the key in the ignition. He brings the car to a fence who gives him $800 for it, and uses the money to hop on a boat and leave NYC. He will state that he's a tourist who is on a permanent vacation.
Jarmusch is one of America's most talented independent directors, who continues to make original films. This is his humble beginning in films, and the result is a well-crafted technical accomplishment with flashes showing of his great ability to tell a story. Permanent Vacation is not for the casual filmgoer, but for one who can appreciate an independent way of looking at film.
