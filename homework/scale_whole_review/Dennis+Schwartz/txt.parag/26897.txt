Robert Mitchum is cast as a stable citizen, going against typecast, who plays the bachelor San Franciscan, Dr. Jeff Cameron. He is burdened with an unbelievable melodramatic story and the dullish performance of his femme fatale co-star, Faith Domergue, as the alluring Margo Lannington, two obstacles that are difficult to overcome. Faith is the gorgeous protege of studio boss Howard Hughes, and makes her inauspicious film debut here.
This is a film that is always enticing but could have been much better served with a different femme fatale playing Faith's part. It was beautifully photographed by Nick Musuraca in the dark B&W style of noir and so ably directed by John Farrow, who successfully caught the nightmarish visions of the tale. It is interesting mostly as a character study of a capable man blinded by lust whose life is almost destroyed. Mitchum is the innocent man who is framed and doesn't realize he is innocent until it is almost too late, recovering in the nick of time because he has such a strong character and will to live. Mitchum's convincing portrayal of the innocent man on the run, is what makes the soap opera story more compelling than it ought to be.
The overworked Dr. Cameron has an unidentified suicide patient thrown on his lap, whom he treats and finds himself attracted to, and when she sends him a telegram with her correct address, he pays her a visit and finds out her name is Margo Lannington. Jeff goes out with her, ignoring his 'nice girl' nurse girlfriend Julie (O'Sullivan), unaware that Margo is married to an elderly millionaire, Frederick (Rains), as she tells him that he's her strict father.
When Margo tells him that she is leaving for a trip to Nassau, Jeff gets tanked up on some kind of potent Hawaiian drink and goes over to meet her dad. He finds the truth out and leaves the house upset that Margo lied to him, but returns when he hears her screams. She claims that Frederick pulled off her earring, and the jealous husband pushes Jeff to the floor and Frederick retaliates as he picks up the fireplace poker and gives Jeff a concussion, before he gets punched out by Jeff. While Jeff retreats for an ice bag for the victim, Margo suffocates her husband with a pillow and pins the murder on Jeff. She refuses to allow Jeff to call the police, saying they will never believe it was an accident and gets Jeff while he's still in a drunken state to drive with her to Mexico, all the time fearful that the police are on their trail. They are so fearful of this, that they fail to get Jeff a prescription to treat his concussion, and go into a panic about everything they do.
In this l'amour fou tale, Jeff begins to become suspicious of his honey as he sobers up, remembering the warnings about her state of mind Frederick mentioned. He will discover in this last dingy border town they travel to how sick she is, after making their way through bleak towns in northern and southern California and through dusty roads in Arizona. They run out of money and have to sell a diamond necklace to some hustlers, who help them plan their escape across the border.
Spoiler to follow: Proceed to last paragraph if you don't want to know the ending.
When Jeff refuses to go with her to Mexico after learning that she killed her husband, she thereby smothers him with a pillow while he is in his weakened condition because of his concussion, leaving alone for Mexico. She is surprised when he comes after her and begs him to go back, but when he continues toward her, she pulls a gun out and starts wildly shooting at him before the cops at the border kill her, but not before she proclaims Jeff's innocence.
The movie plays like a noir cliché. But Mitchum saves the day, realistically showing how a swell guy and such a competent doctor could be so vulnerable. Claude Rains as always is magnificent, in a small part but one where his every gesture seems to be constrained in a maniacal rage ready to burst open. The touch of madness he brings to the film, is best exemplified by his mischievous smile while meeting his wife's lover, Mitchum.
