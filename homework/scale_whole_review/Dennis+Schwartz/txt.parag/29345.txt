A Monogram cheapie that holds up fairly well as a low-budget B-film noir, featuring Robert Mitchum in his first starring role. It's directed by the noted schlock thriller director William Castle, who lets the story simply unfold and doesn't embellish it with the gimmicks he was later on to employ in his career of making horror exploitation films.
In a Philadelphia hotel, a very drunk Sam Prescott enters the bar just before closing time with a lion's head on and stupidly mentions to the one patron whose face is unseen and the bartender (Lubin) present, that he has $10,000 in cash on him. The patron doesn't have a hotel room and Sam generously offers to share it with him. The next morning he's found murdered in his room and his cash is missing. The newspapers dub it the case of the Silk Stocking murder, as the vic was strangled with silk stockings.
Millie Baxter (Kim Hunter) leaves her small town Ohio home and goes to a New York hotel as arranged, to meet her travelling salesman husband of a month, Paul Baxter (Dean Jagger). She has only been with him a couple of times since they met in the Ohio restaurant where she was a waitress, and he left her after one day of marriage to hit the road. They are still really strangers.
Instead of meeting him at the hotel she meets in the lobby her former beau from her hometown, also a travelling salesman, Fred Graham (Mitchum). He's surprised that she's married and of all things to a salesman, as he quips: "You didn't marry me because I was a salesman. Evidently he's a better salesman than me." He asks her if she received a letter he wrote her in Ohio, and she tells him no. When Paul doesn't show up the next day and she doesn't even know where he works in NYC, Fred takes her to the police and into homicide detective Lt. Blake's office to report her husband missing.
When Paul telephones her the next day and tells her to come alone to meet him at an out of the way cafe, Fred tails her and when Paul sees him he flees. Millie becomes suspicious of his strange behavior and fears he might be the wanted killer, as she thinks she might have made a mistake in this marriage. But she somehow trusts him and runs away with him. When he says he was the man in Prescott's room and was tempted by seeing the money but when he left Prescott, he was alive and had all his money--she believes him. But the police suspect that he was the killer and begin a manhunt for him, capturing him just as he finishes telling Millie he's innocent.
It comes down to either him or Fred being the killer, and that isn't settled until the climax scene and the surprise ending.
If you don't expect much, you'll be pleased with many of the graceful film noir touches this low-budget film has and the way it created a chilling NYC atmosphere for the story to be played out. Hunter is alone and scared to be in the big city, but she always trusts her instincts. It's a minor film, but it does a good job of providing some thrills and has its moments of pure visual delights: like of Hunter staring out her hotel window and her face illuminated by a flashing neon sign as jazz sounds are coming from the street.
