This film was made in mainland China and is one of the great and courageous films of the 1990s. It's by Tian Zhuangzhuang (Horse Thief). It has been banned in China for its political content, and the director has not had another film of his released overseas. It follows the story of a fictional family from their wedding in 1953, at the time Stalin died, to a year later at the birth of their child, and all the way until the harsh consequences of their lives have finally sunk in by 1968 as being irreversible. It is narrated by their young boy Tietou as an adult, with different actors portraying him as he grows up (Chen Xiaoman as a teenager was the most memorable of these performers). Tietou tries to make sense out of what happens to his ordinary family, but he just can't seem to fully comprehend why so much misfortune occurred. It is a tragic tale of a mother holding her family together, as they are caught up in the fervor of political zealots who need scapegoats to go after those who are different.
"The Blue Kite" is the most acrimonious indictment in a film of Chairman Mao's regime, that I can recall. It begins with the Rectification Movement and moves through the Great Leap Forward and the brutal extremes of the Cultural Revolution. The picture best demonstrates how the politics and history of the revolutionary times affect the lives of real people. How from year to year there is great changes in what set of beliefs to follow, and the worst thing is to be accused of being a Rightist, a counterrevolutionary. This provocative film is not a flattering look at the myopic political situation in modern China. It tells of simple truths, emphasizing family life, while it is brilliantly crafted in a most moving way.
The story mostly takes place in the crowded apartment complexes in Beijing, where Tietou lives with his father, Shaolong (Pu Quanxin), who is a librarian and his mother, Shujuan (Lu Liping), who is a teacher. The extended familily of a sister and brothers and grandma live nearby, also live in simply furnished apartments. Times are difficult, there is not enough food, but everyone seems happy and there is a sense of strong family ties and a strong comradeship among neighbors. There is also an air of innocence and fun that seems to be contagious. It is a time for Tietou to fly his blue kite and for his kindly father to make another one if this one gets stuck in a tree.
The most critical development for the family, is when the library staff is called into a meeting. The staff is told by the party bureaucrats that it has not been self-critical of itself and has not been able to find any reactionaries among them. In the middle of the discussion, Shaolong goes to the bathroom. When he returns, there is an eerie silence, with everyone looking at him. Unfortunately, it is he who has been deemed as the reactionary. He is thereby ordered to go away for reeducation to a collective labor farm. He will die there in an accident when a tree falls on him.
The mother's life is a difficult one. She is trying to adjust to the changing political climate, as she tries to give her full love to Tietou, who has difficulty understanding what has happened to the family. She will go through two more marriages - as she weds an army officer, an old friend of the family, and later to a prosperous party official, who is a quiet and erudite man. He makes the best of that marriage knowing that Tietou doesn't like him. In each marriage, it is shown how the politics of the revolution alters the family's togetherness in a deleterious way. The point of the story is that the bonds between mother and child remain strong, no matter what.
"The Blue Kite" explores in detail what happened in recent times when mob rule took over China and hooligans marched through the streets, denouncing fellow citizens for reactionary behavior, all in the patriotic name of a Cultural Revolution. This film accurately captured the mentality of those who go along with such acts, those who are brainwashed into always thinking they are right and ignoring all the harm they do to people that might have different opinions than they do, people who just want to live peacefully and have decent lives. It is surprising that this film got out of the repressive clutches of China. It clearly showed the horrors of the human drama inflicted on its subjects, the tremendous portrayal of motherhood by Lu Liping, and the oppression emanating from the Chinese dictatorship. This lyrical film offers an eye-opening experience about recent events there, and probably the only people it can't penetrate, are the Maoist International Movement, a group that is in self-denial about how tyrannical China is. For them the family will be seen as counterrevolutionaries and have gotten what they deserved.
