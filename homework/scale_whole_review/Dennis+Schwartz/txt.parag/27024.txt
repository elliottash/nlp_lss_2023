An alluring biopic about the provocative comedian Andy Kaufman that couldn't go futher than to provide an entertaining look at the entertainer. If one was looking to find out who Andy Kaufman was, this film would be of little help. The point of the film being that there was probably no difference between the performer and the person off-stage, therefore it believes by telling the story through only his performances should give one a good enough idea of who Andy was. Every other character besides Andy in the film seemed wooden, whose only purpose was to look up and stare at him as if he were a God or sneer at him as if he was the Devil. The Kaufman role was tailor-made for Jim Carrey and he comes through with flying colors in a virtuoso performance, as this fictionalized biography of Kaufman, shows his odd personality, obsessions, and mind-set.
The film seemed flat in the parts when Carrey wasn't performing and his story seemed superficial. I didn't feel as if I knew him any better because of this film than I did before, though, at least, the film didn't try to answer something it couldn't. But "Man on the Moon" was entertaining, even for someone like me who has never been impressed by his comic talents.
The film about 'the king of negative energy' starts with a prologue, where Jim Carrey says, "Hello ... I am Andy." He then convinces us without a doubt that is exactly who he is. He first shows us his abnormal childhood, where he would play alone and perform his act before an imaginary audience in his room rather than play with other children, greatly upsetting his parents. He is raised in the affluent Long Island suburb of Great Neck, but before we can gather anything else about his childhood and his relations with his parents and his sister, we are quickly whisked from here to Andy as a young adult doing an unfunny act at a nightclub, where we have no trouble seeing how he would be fired, which is indeed what happens. Suddenly he turns up doing an Elvis impersonation at a comedy club attended by super-agent George Shapiro (DeVito) and he's taken on by the agent who thinks he might have discovered a comic genius, and soon he becomes a star on 'Saturday Night Live.' From there he lands a starring role in a new sitcom, 'Taxi,' and is allowed to make a number of demands from the producers in order to land him, as he always tries to push the limits on what he can do. This might be the way it happened, but it made for bad cinema since he wasn't seen as being funny and his immediate rise to fame lacked credibility as it was filmed, even though we know it evidently did happen.
The heart of the film and indeed what keeps it lively, is watching Carrey go through his repertoire in a flawless comic manner. He seems to have all of Andy's top acts down pat, as he has the ability to do impeccable imitations of Kaufman as an impersonator, such as the buggy wide-eyed immigrant Latka; the confrontational wrestler bullying the women he fights with in the ring; his ongoing scripted spat with the wrestler Jerry Lawler which appealed to the crowds baser instincts; performing a reading of the entire "The Great Gatsby" to a bored college audience; performing as the obnoxious Tony Clifton (his alter ego), who is a lounge singer who goads his audience on in a hostile manner; and, acting childish while doing lip-syncs to a phonograph record of the "Mighty Mouse" theme song, as he would sing out "Here I come to save the day!" He thrived in his short-lived career in the 1970s, until his death from cancer in 1984 at the age of 35, on being unpredictable, presenting a stand-up act that was hard to define because of his uniqueness.
Milos Forman's uneven film is missing the true craziness of Kaufman in the entirety of the story. He gets that ingredient not from the conventional way he tells the story but only from Jim Carrey's expressive performance, as the film went from bursts of great energy with Carrey doing Andy to dullness in storytelling.
The most jejune part was reserved for Courtney Love as Andy's girlfriend Lynne. Her part was so underwritten that there weren't even hints of where the romance or sex in it was, and there appeared to be no intimacy between them. She just seemed to be Andy's prop, who looks delicious on the screen but was given nothing to do, but one turn on the wrestling mat.
What we are left pondering, is if Andy is weird and gimmicky enough to invite a whole audience out for milk and cookies after he played out his dream of appearing in Carnegie Hall, could he also be capable of faking his own death. I can't help thinking, that aside from Carrey's masterful performance, there's not much in this film to take away with you. The film seems to be an unadultered homage to Kaufman, looking on the rosy side of his lunacy and not getting at anything else. Kaufman seemed to always be searching for something, whether in studying Transcendental Meditation, looking for a psychic cure for cancer in the Philippines, or a way to push the limits of comedy to a further degree, and what we see in the film, is that he never quite found what he was looking for, in a career that was far too short for a man of his energies and stated talents.
