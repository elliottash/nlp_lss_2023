An attempt at being a dramatic social conscience film, based on the short story by Hanif Kureishi (My Beautiful Laundrette/Sammy and Rosie get Laid), about an emigre family who came 25- years ago from Pakistan to the economically depressed industrial city of Bradford, in the north of England. The father is the pock-marked, leathery faced, middle-aged taxi driver Parvez (Om Puri), who has assimilated into the English culture, snobbishly looking down his nose at those who don't behave properly. His wife Minoo (Gopi Desai) is subservient to him but not respectful of him, never having fully adjusted to her adopted country, saving all her love for her spoiled son Farid (Akbar Kurtha), as her husband works long hours and to her, seems to be without ambition, as their relationship grows distant. At the start of the story, Farid is a seemingly typical self-satisfied second generation son of an immigrant, who is a studious accountant college student and a fun loving guitar player. He is engaged to an English girl Madelaine (Sarah-Jane Potts), who works as a bank teller; her father is the local police chief (Bateman), which pumps Parvez up with pride that the son of a dark-skinned immigrant could be going out with a local white girl, who comes from a family that has such prestige in town. In an unconvincing and one of the film's many overdramatic scenes, Farid breaks off the relationship because of his sudden new interest in Islamic fundamentalism and his reaction to how the local population disrespects the dark-skinned "Pakis" and look down at his father because of his lowly status. His new stance in life brings displeasure to his father, though it brings happiness to the police chief, who by his tight facial expression when in the presence of the family, displays his racial prejudice.
This very predictable social drama will have every character be a walking cliché, every major event be a contrived one, and it will do everything it could do to convince the audience that assimilation is the way to go, but get out on the pulpit and preach against racial hatred. It is good to have such tolerant beliefs, don't get me wrong, but to make such a boring and muddled picture about it, is not a good thing.
The naive but indulgent father, is hard-working, though is not always as ethical as he should be (he drinks too much, stays out late with another woman, and is sort of a pimp to a local prostitute). While his reactionary son, is someone who spouts fundamental diatribes against white people and, especially, Jews, as they clash over what each of them believes to be true. Parvez spends most of the film railing against his son's belief and his ingratitude for how hard he had to work to support the family, rationalizing his own worldly beliefs, while his son's disappointment with his father's Western ways, gives way to a hatred for his father, as he rejects him and goes marching off with his militant fundamentalist group.
The film's themes about religious fanatics, family problems, prostitution, hypocrisy, jealousy over a friend's success, the immigration problem, bigotry, the problems a young man has in growing up, a father-son frictional relationship, social hierarchy, male abuse towards women, the tribulations of a workaholic, love, loneliness, the need for warmth, and cultural clashes, are just too many themes for one film to have. The filmmaker is all over the cricket field with these problems, but just can't make this long list of problems have any lasting interest for the film goer. And, as if these weren't enough problems, some more come up when the taxi driver takes as his fare, a German industrialist, Stellan Skarsgård, who goes by the name of Schitz (you can see for yourself what goes for humor here, as you try to pronounce that name). He comes here on business and as a diversion, Parvez supplies him with women and one in particular, Parvez's dear prostitute friend, someone he feels very comfortable talking to, Bettina (Rachel Griffiths). As a way of incrementing his salary, Parvez arranges places for the sexually masochistic industrialist to have orgies in and pays off the girls with the industrialist's cash. But he develops a serious relationship with the prostitute who has a heart of gold (Did you ever hear of any other kind of a prostitute in a cliché movie?), as she gives him the warmth he can't get at home, and their relationship is built on a mutual trust for each other.
When it comes down to the nitty-gritty of things, this uncompelling film can't make up its mind on how it stands on some of the major issues it brings to the table. By the film's end I don't know how to feel about Parvez's romance with the prostitute, as it certainly breaks up his family life but gives him a temporary renewed self-respect and hope. But there is no resolution to what all the fuss was about over her being a prostitute and what will come of their relationship. Is the filmmaker for or against prostitution? And the question remains, what was that final scene all about, of angry Moslems stoning and bombing a whorehouse in the neighborhood of the Mosque, while the father pulls his son away from Bettina and then throws the German industrialist out of his cab. For me, it was just an unbelievable scene, and to boot, it didn't clear up anything about the mainstream Moslem official position on the negativity toward prostitution. In fact, I didn't learn anything about Moslems except to see them as the stereotypes they are most of the time depicted as in most other mainstream films.
Om Puri (In Custody/City of Joy/Target) is an accomplished actor from India, whose trademark face and ability to be very expressive and exuberant, engages the film with his sense of what it is to be a decent person. He looks at his adopted country like an exile- with one foot planted back to his native Pakistan but his other foot firmly planted in the new country. There is something about him that identifies with those who are outsiders, as long as they are not fanatics or troublemakers. But the filmmaker doesn't even attempt to play fair, the story is told totally from his point of view, all the others around him are one-dimensional characters, who are not only uninteresting but they are for the most part made to appear annoying. I'm talking about his fanatical son, his old-fashioned wife, his vulnerable prostitute friend, the industrialist (his part was the most undeveloped one in the film), and the moralizing friend he came from Pakistan with, Fizzy (Harish Patel), the one he is envious of, who became a successful restaurant owner and a better provider for his family than he was, but who adds nothing but more clichés to a story that is already full of clichés.
In the closing credits we see how isolated the exiled father is (meaning- he will always be an exile in his adopted England). This is pointed out as he goes from room to room in his empty house and a jazz song plays "There is no peace till hatred passes."
That Parvez is a decent guy, with a good attitude, is probably not as true as the filmmaker thinks. Didn't he treat his wife unfairly and fail to communicate with his troubled son? That this film doesn't have the power to say anything important that hasn't been heard many times before, is my take on it. But the worst thing about this film, is that it is a snoozer, not able to make its story about the virtues of being faithful to your culture and your wife come to life, as it is mired down in one cliché after another. The best thing to say about this art- house type of film, is that it should upset no one: it is so bland and unexciting that it is hard to tell what all the fuss is about. I can't get too worked up over a father who is the rebel in the household instead of the son, or if the father falls for the heavenly prostitute who is so human (she even snorts coke), or about a bunch of intolerant religious fanatics who are hypocrites, who descry the West but nevertheless want to live here. There was just nothing here to get worked up about. I just assume people immigrate to Western countries to earn a better living, there is no big deal in exposing that. But, you can be sure of one thing, this Moslem filmmaker did not pull a Salman Rushdie with this film. He won't be on any fundamentalist hit list.
