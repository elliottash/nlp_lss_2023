At last, a black comedy, coming-of-age, romantic melodrama about teenagers in rebellion that is not a formulaic clichéd one and actually makes an attempt to flesh out the character of a teen who is searching for something that is not trivial, as she lashes back at being stuck in the urban sprawl scene of LA that is inhabitated by so many shallow and phony people. It's filmed by documentary filmmaker Terry Zwigoff, a nerd himself, who gave us the excellent documentary Crumb. Ghost World is based on Daniel Clowes's underground comic book series--though the story is dramatically expanded. The comic book drawings were done by Robert Crumb's daughter Sophie. He, of course, is the great comic book illustrator.
It's a film that best captures the uncertainty in the life of a very bright recent high school graduate who is a misfit, Enid (Thora Birch). She uses intellectual barbs and pure scorn to fend off her foes who are: anyone new she meets, waiters, would-be friends and even her appeasing single-parent dad (Balaban) and his girlfriend (Garr) she can't stomach because of her pushiness. She saves most of her wrath for her vacuous high school classmates, all of whom are preoccupied either with going to college, fitting into society or going straight into the serious workforce. She and her girlfriend Rebecca (Johansson) choose not to go to college, get involved with boys, or plan for a career. They are close high school friends who will soon have a more distant relationship as they have different needs and can't keep up their intense friendship when out of the school environment--which gave them their common enemy: the high school.
Enid has one obstacle before getting her high school diploma, she must go to summer school to take a remedial art appreciation course she failed. She's saddled with a gooey teacher (Illeana Douglas) who makes art secondary to conforming with society, as she praises the students who create safe politically correct art works rather than praising those who take risks and create works of art. She promises much to Enid and, as one might expect, delivers little.
Rebecca who is attractive and Aryan looking, but who identifies with the Jewish Enid, decides to work at a pretentious coffee shop and get an apartment with her. Enid, meanwhile, fumbles a popcorn vender job in a movie theater by mistreating the customer's she hates and spends the summer mischievously searcing for something that she doesn't even know she's looking for.
The main plot develops out of a tasteless joke the girls play on a loser, who put an ad in the personals of a local newspaper for the blonde woman he met at the airport to call him. Enid calls pretending to be that woman and leaves a message on his answering machine to meet her at a vintage '50s retro diner. The girlfriends get Josh (Renfro), a classmate now working at a counter job at a convenience shop, to go with them to the diner and see what this dwork looks like. He turns out to be a sad loner named Seymour (Steve Buscemi), whom they follow home. When she meets this much older man whose passion is collecting valuable 78 rpm records of old-fashioned country and blues music and old advertising art, she's surprised that they have similar socially unacceptable personalities that are unbending and vulnerable--which makes it very difficult for them to have relationships. She's, at last, met her kindred soulmate, but they are both such social misfits that even that recognition might not be enough to bring them together. He tells her he obsessively collects things to make up for not having relationships with others. At first goofing on him, she soon decides to help him find a woman to date and when the real Dana he put the ad in the paper for calls--she gets him to call her. But soon becomes jealous when she realizes that she really wanted to go out with him and now tries to destroy this budding relationship. It is one that Seymour is willing to have even if it means he has to compromise all his beliefs to keep it going, as he curiously says "I don't want to meet someone who shares my interests. I hate my interests."
He works days at a nondescript managerial office job for a fast food chicken place, that he tells her once had the racist name of Coon's Chicken but changed to Cooks to avoid any controversy.
Through his unapologetic loneliness she sees her own, and even though this film is not geared for a predictable or a happy ending, it's this relationship with all its incongruities that is so fascinating, touching and tender to behold. It certainly sharpened their awareness of who they were, and the poetical ending is fitting for a free flowing story like this one. I honestly can't remember how long its been since I have seen a teenage film as memorable as this one (Rushmore comes the closest).
