An action-packed WW11 film about marines landing on a Japanese-controlled Pacific Island and overcoming rocket fire while being badly outnumbered. A more than adequate telling of the standard-type of 1950s hard-nosed war film, which is helped greatly by an outstanding cast. Throughout the film, starting at its opening moments, the patriotic "Halls of Montezuma" song is rousingly played whenever there is a call for flagwaving. Lewis Milestone, the director of this ode to war film, was curiously enough, noted for directing in 1930, one of the most reknown anti-war films, All Quiet on the Western Front.
In "Halls of Montezuma," Milestone emphasizes the lives of the characters in the battle-tested 2nd Marine Company, rather than the battle scenes. In some battle scenes, the real documentary war shots are added to the film action, which gives the film a gritty look.
The respected company leader is Lieutenant Anderson (Widmark), who was a high school chemistry teacher before the war. He has led these marines through Guadacanal and his aim is to keep the seven survivors from his old platoon alive. But there is something noticeably wrong with him; he is having severe migraines. The film uses a flashback to show how the medical corpsman (Malden) has known about Anderson's condition for some time, but he has been asked by him to keep it private, because if the authorities found out about it, he would be sent home and he wants to finish the war with his fighting men. The corpsman feeds him pain killers when the headaches get really bad and he doesn't disclose this information.
On the boat, before the men land on the beach, Cpl. Conroy (Hylton) asks Anderson to give him a discharge, that he has cracked after the last battle and is afraid of the up-coming one. Milestone changes the voice-tone of Anderson's speech so that we know that what we are now hearing are his private thoughts. With the aid of flashback, we see that Anderson while teaching, had a new student come into his class who stuttered. This was Conroy, who through Anderson's help was able to overcome his fear of speaking. With this in mind, Anderson convinces Conroy to not give in to this fear and carry-out his mission. Both headaches and stuttering are caused, according to Anderson, by fear.
The men when they land on the beach meet little resistance, but when they try to take a ridge, they are met with machine-gun fire from the pillboxes above. When they secure their position after heavy casualties, the men receive orders from the officer in charge of this operation, Lt. Col. Gilfilan (Boone), that they must capture some Japanese prisoners rather than trying to kill them as before. The reason is that they are being attacked by rockets on the island and want to interrogate any prisoner to see if they can get the location where those rockets are.
The colonel gets Anderson to take his men and a British-born sergeant, Johnson (Gardiner), who can speak Japanese, to get some Japanese prisoners hiding in a cave to give up. Of course, the dangers in this assignment, is that the Japanese prisoner who came to them about where the soldiers were, might be leading them into an ambush.
The men who distinguish themselves from Anderson's company are all the typical characters found in these types of films: Robert Wagner is a radio man loyal to his fellow soldiers; Bert Freed is a tough marine private who is battle-experienced, but can't behave properly when there are no battles; Jack Webb is a war correspondent who is writing a book about the war, and is eager to experience a battle; Neville Brand is a tough sergeant who gets blinded, but still believes he is doing the right thing by fighting for his country; Skip Homeier is a troubled boy who doesn't want to be a nobody and is a little bit gun crazy, who joined the marines to become a man; Jack Palance is a boxer in civilian life, who is grateful that Skip saved his life and tries to straighten the kid out; and, Karl Malden who gets fatally shot and writes a patriotic letter that he wants read to the men, stating that America's cause is just and that God is on America's side.
The Japanese are de-humanized, as they are routinely called Nips and the officers say, "A good Jap, is a dead one." The film doesn't pretend to be more than a routine WW11 war film reflecting the political mood of when it was made, that should be pleasing for those who like simple-minded action flicks. It is well-crafted by Milestone's even-handed direction and it ably presents the characters of the men and lets the story build in action after a slow start, so that when some of the men die, you at least know who they were.
