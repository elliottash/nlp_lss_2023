Reviewed by Dennis Schwartz
A "feel good" movie about unemployment in the steel-mill town of Sheffield, England, and how these layed off workers overcome their misfortunes and gain self-respect by using their will power to do something that is out of character for them; that is, they become strippers. Yes, they become male strippers...The story is predictable, likable, and soapy. It leaves one all fuzzy and cuddly inside, as the film uses risque material to make its point, yet it is almost totally devoid of hot sex. It traps you in its formula mode; you can't help wishing these blokes do well. They represent a universal paradigm: there is the loner, the aging man representing the minorities, the prude who is really a swell guy, the untalented but well-endowed fellow, the insecure one who is also obese, and the regular "Joe" down on his luck.
Well, rest assured, things turn out well, they all have a good sport with their one night of a full monty (which is a total strip) in front of a ladies only audience.
The film's popularity does not surprise me, people seem to like quick solutions to their problems and films where thinking is not a prerequisite for enjoying it. I have a feeling that this film will age poorly, and like a lot of trendy films, will not look good a few years from now. I thought it offered just so-so entertainment value. It never gave me the impression that I was seeing something that mattered. The full monty as promised, was not even delivered.
