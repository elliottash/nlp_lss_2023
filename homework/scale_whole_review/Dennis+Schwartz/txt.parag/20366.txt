The moral dilemma is that two friends must choose whether to help a third friend who was arrested in Malaysia for drug possession. He will be hung in eight days after spending two years in jail if they don't return and each do three years, or if one of them returns, he must do six years. These three young men were post-college vacationing in Malaysia, as one of them called it, "a paradise of rum, girls and good cheap hash."
When Sheriff (Vaughn) and Tony (Conrad) left to return to NYC, Lewis (Phoenix) stood behind to be an activist for Greenpeace's cause of saving the orangutan in Borneo. But before they left, they rented a 3-man bike which they never returned to their owner because a truck knocked them off the road and Sheriff threw the broken bike away rather than have it slow them down from walking back to town. The next day the police came to their residence on the bike owner's request, and they found more than a brick of hashish in the trash bin, just where Sheriff deposited it, and charged the occupant there, Lewis, with being a drug trafficker for having so much hashish in his sole posssession.
Joseph Ruben (Sleeping With the Enemy/The Stepfather/Gorp/The Good Son) has directed a lot of films that are just plain awful, as you could see from those mentioned above, except for the adequately made SWTE. He directed this predictable drama with a heavy hand as it lapses into melodramatics after a very emotionally moving start and after presenting a most interesting premise; it is just too bad that the script had no conviction to follow through on its premise. It fails to really answer the question it raised about the moral duty one has in going back to a Malaysian prison for a very casual friend, someone whom it is unlikely you will ever see again. The weakness of the film can be found in the director's lack of courage in understanding what a decision like this really entails to the person involved, and by making the film all about the Anne Heche character instead of focusing mainly on the two boys, as the film loses its sense of direction. By adding sidebars to the simple premise, it changes the question considerably and takes the edge off what decision is made. The director spoon feeds the answer that he thinks the audience wants, and it all seems to be a predictable formula driven film instead of one filled with a raw energy. After mid-film, any logical attempt at soul searching for what to do was lost in a series of obvious contrivances and clichés that were displeasing to watch. Bad directors do such things to good ideas.
The story picks up two years after the opening dreamy sequences of the boys enjoying themselves in exotic Malaysia. Beth (Heche) is in the limo driven by the cavalier and free-spirited Brooklyn born Sheriff, who hustled his way into going on that vacation by getting a frequent flyer ticket. She tells him she is a lawyer for his friend Lewis and is laying on him the details of Lewis' imprisonment, asking him to save his life. Heche is intense and persistent, not letting up on the less than eager Sheriff to make such a commitment. She fails in her attempt to bribe him with money and then she meets Tony, who Sheriff hasn't seen since their return from Malaysia, who is now a successful architect, just engaged. He tells her that he couldn't do the six years but would go back for three years if Sheriff goes, also. Here the story gets side-tracked for bad reasons. One, a stereotypical annoying reporter (M.J.) is brought into the story to show how irresponsible the press is. The reporter threatens to break the story, even as Beth tells her that her client will surely be killed if she does, that these third world countries over-react when they are put under the spotlight of the world press. And, the second annoying development to the story, is the unbelievable romance that develops between Beth and Sheriff. It is especially unbelievable because Sheriff just mentioned how she would try anything to get him to go back and to now believe that Sheriff would fall for her after saying that, just doesn't add up.
The only scene that made sense from this point on in the story, was the one where Tony's fiancée (Vera) asks some intelligent questions of the lawyer and fails to illicit responses that would make me want to go back. For instance, it is illicited from Beth that there is no guarantees in writing that Tony will only get three years. To think of going to a prison in Malaysia without an official representative of the U.S. government available to offer advice and confirmation of what is actually happening, is simply ludicrous. Who in their right mind would unquestionably believe what Beth is saying? That the carefree Sheriff will become the responsible good guy afterall and really go back to redeem his former irresponsible behavior, is an old formula story and you can see that being the setup from the very first reel of the picture, where he rescues Lewis from unsavory Malaysian drug dealers.
That he goes back because he falls in love with Beth, sends a wrong message about the dilemma the film's premise poses. That is too easy a reason. The real question is, would one do what they can to save another's life without getting anything in return for it? The answer to that question can only be answered individually and according to the current situation one is in. Heroes usually don't know if they are going to be heroes, they just do what is right at the moment. It is instinctual. In this case, from what I have seen of Beth's direct confrontational approach, as difficult as it might be to say no, I think most people in Tony's shoes would have no choice but refuse her request. As the story gets played out and we find out that Beth is holding something back from the boys, the fact that she is Lewis's sister, changes everything, anyway. At least, it does for Tony.
The acting was not that convincing, except one could make an argument for Joaquin Phoenix and the real fear he shows in the prison cell and on the video tape he sends to his two friends. The scene of Lewis in the Malaysian jail, which is actually a jail cell in the Philadelphia prison system, of him rambling on incoherently, complaining about the cell being godless, I thought, more than being good acting, smacked of melodrama and was not a very convincing portrayal of someone going over the edge; but, it was scary.
My thinking is, if Lewis was that crazed-out and fearful of dying, why did he wait until the last moment to contact his pals?
I just wonder how many would honestly go back to save Lewis if they were in Tony's shoes or in Sheriff's shoes.
I also wonder how good this film could have been in the hands of a Fritz Lang or even an Elia Kazan, or a modern director such as a Martin Scorsese. And that is the shame of this somber picture, it failed to move me and seemed to turn into a slight story, and this is after all its contrivances.
