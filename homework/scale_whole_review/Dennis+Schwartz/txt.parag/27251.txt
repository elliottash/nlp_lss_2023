A cute family drama/comedy about destiny and the choices one makes. This indie film is set in Chicago, comparing the protagonist's working-class background in the produce market with the high culture of the opera world he rejected. George Krikkos (Tom Bastounes) is being divorced by his wife Jill (Burns), as the final straw comes when she catches him sneaking home late at night after a tryst. She will be getting married again shortly and taking with her their young son (Coren Caldwell). In this one week period of George's life, there will be other traumatic changes, his father will be retiring after selling the produce business he works at, with George staying on with his brother Dean to work for the new bosses. But...the biggest surprise is when his former girlfriend and classmate of 20 years ago, arrives in Chicago to perform. She is now an internationally famous diva in the opera, known as Gina Spenza (Monica Zaffarano).
George seems in a rut...not enthusiastic about his work or his prospects, going out with a girlfriend (Moore) who borders on being a psycho, and wondering what if he didn't give up a potential singing career for the produce business -- where would he now be! He gets a chance to relive the past, as he meets Gina and they rekindle their romance. She is currently seeing a silver-haired senator (White) from New Hampshire and is on a 5-day whirlwind tour of Chicago. They date and the next day she gets him to sing an opera aria at a senior citizen center, which is well received in the newspapers. This gets his picture in the paper with her and the attention of the jealous senator, who immediately comes to Chicago, where he puts on the enraged boyfriend act.
Her managers have a divided opinion about giving George a shot at singing something spontaneously in her show, but she sides with giving him a chance, as she aims to make opera more accessible to the public and not to be only for the purists. To sing in public and why he can't finish what he starts, becomes his battle with his inner demons. The film ultimately is about whom does she love more -- the artist or the prominent politician. I bet you can guess who wins!
This was a likable but not a particularly moving tale. The characters were pleasing, but no more. The situation they were in seemed realistic, and the way they handled themselves gave the film its comedy sparks. But what the film was missing, was sparks from the romance. What the film also lacked was a more telling story and a bit more tension. It seemed to be played too loose and easy, as if the problems that come his way were part of the problems one would expect to find in any sitcom. Nevertheless, I loved the atmosphere the film created -- of mixing the stock workingman types with the stock opera types, and with George cutting a nifty path to his destiny between his two chosen fields of endeavor. As for the opera singing -- let me shout from the rafters, Bravo!!!
