In URBAN LEGENDS: FINAL CUT, the film students are preparing their thesis films. The best of the bunch could win the prestigious Hitchcock Award, something that URBAN LEGENDS: FINAL CUT would have no chance of winning.
Why don't they make sequels of movies whose characters we would like to know more about -- THE BIG CHILL, for example? The original URBAN LEGEND, which is pretty bad, is a decidedly watchable movie compared to its schlocky sequel.
With a homogeneous group of young actors playing almost completely interchangeable characters, the movie is slapped together by its director (John Ottman) and writers (Silvio Horta, Paul Harris Boardman and Scott Derrickson) like a toddler with Duplo blocks. As blood splatters everywhere, the film uses every cliché in the horror movie writer's manual, from stupid victims to loud noises. There isn't an incident in it that you haven't seen done before, and frequently better.
There is simply no reason to waste your money on this movie, which wouldn't be worth seeing if it were the only thing showing in town. If you want to see a good movie about urban legends, URBANIA, currently playing the art houses, covers this ground with style, even if the film is a thriller rather than a horror movie. If it's a horror movie you're after, perhaps the best ever made, THE EXORCIST, complete with new footage and a new digital soundtrack, is currently playing at your local multiplex.
URBAN LEGENDS: FINAL CUT runs a long 1:40. It is rated R for violence, gore, language and some sexuality and would be acceptable for high school seniors and older.
