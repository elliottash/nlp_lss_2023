I would like to share with others that THE FISHER KING is on my top of my worst movies of the year list. Yes, I know the critics are going gaga over it.
I found the Jeff Bridges character to be a total loser. His character taught me nothing other than it is pretty awful spending a lot of time with an alcoholic dead beat even if he is only on a movie screen.
I found Robin Williams's character somewhat better, but spending hours a bum with a mental problem was not exactly terrific either. Yes, I know I could use the politically correct term, "homeless", and then I would have to view him reverentially.
After an hour I walked out. I only wish I had been smart enough to do it sooner. I found that the images, especially that of Jeff Bridges, stayed with me for a while, and I did not like it. He was someone I wish I had never met.
**** = One of the top few films of this or any year. A must see film. *** = Excellent show. Look for it. ** = Average movie. Kind of enjoyable. * = Poor show. Don't waste your money. 0 = One of the worst films of this or any year. Totally unbearable.
