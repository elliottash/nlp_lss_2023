Some countries seem to specialize in certain movie genres. As the entire world knows, America can make special effects blockbusters like no other country. Then again, few countries can afford to bankroll such risky ventures.
For low key, working class comedies full of droll humor, few countries can equal the Irish. Novelist and screenwriter Roddy Doyle can be placed in the center of contemporary Irish writers. THE VAN is based on the last of his Barrytown trilogy. The first two novels were made into the well received movies, THE COMMITMENTS and THE SNAPPER. (Look on the back of the fish 'n chips and burger van in THE VAN, and you'll see "Beware The Snapper" as a little in-joke to remind the audience of the last movie while also poking fun at the merchandise.)
"Got a bit of bad news today," says Bimbo at the pub to his old buddy Larry. "Let go. Been made redundant." Larry can empathize with him since he's been out of work for years -- on the dole as they say.
Keeping busy is hard for these middle age men, but they are willing to try anything including golf in the pouring rain while pushing around a rain gear covered toddler.
Donal O'Kelly plays Bimbo, the more serious of the two. Bimbo does not find being out of work as easy to take as his more jovial companion Larry, played by Colm Meaney from the other films in the trilogy as well as CON AIR. Together the two of them craft a good spirited comedy. Although it turns somewhat bittersweet towards the end, the chemistry between them hums like a smooth running and happy little engine. Their story is rarely exciting, but always congenial.
Director Stephen Frears (DANGEROUS LIAISIONS) has the good sense to never try to make the movie more than it is, a small tale of two friends coping through some troublesome times. It is in the minutia, which he handles with such a deft touch, that the show has its charm. Larry feels his family needs to economize but isn't even willing to substitute chicken for turkey for the Christmas dinner. He asks rhetorically, "What's Christmas without a turkey?" (The beauty and the challenge of the film is the thick Irish accents. "Turkey" becomes a long, involved, and particularly melodious word.)
One of their friends offers to sell Bimbo a derelict fast food van. Larry's wife, Maggie (Ger Ryan), takes one look at the beat-up wreck, caked in grime, and asks the seller, "What about the engine?" Surprised, he shoots back, "What engine would that be Maggie?" Yes, the lack of a motor is one of its many deficiencies. Figuring they can pull it with their car, Bimbo buys it and gets Larry to be his partner. "Bimbo's Burgers," they name it. ("Bimbo" apparently does not have the same connotation on their side of the Atlantic.)
Except for one outlandish episode where a accidentally fried nappy (which we Americans call a diaper) is sold as fried fish, most of the humor is so understated that it rarely elicits more than a small giggle from the audience. This lack of any substantial laughs in a comedy will probably be its downfall. Those used to broad comedy with slapstick humor are likely to be disappointed by this subtle story. But those willing to cut it a little slack, will find our two unlikely heroes quite appealing.
Most of the show has to do with the trials and tribulations of running a small business in which they have no experience. (Since they must move the van to locations where people will buy their products, Maggie wonders, "Do heavy metalers eat chips?" It turns out they do, but they have other attributes that make them less than ideal customers.)
The beautiful cinematography by Oliver Stapleton, who did the stunning work in RESTORATION, comes alive in the night sequences. The warm glow of the incandescent light of the interior of the van at night makes Larry's and Bimbo's business somehow magical.
The show ends abruptly. Several scenes which you are convinced are just around the corner, never occur. Like a dream, the writer lets each of us decide how we want it to turn out. The visual at the conclusion is the picture's best, and one worth savoring.
THE VAN runs 1:36 but feels shorter. It is rated R for constant use of the F word. (Larry's family has a "swear fund" jar, which is unrealistically small.) The film would be fine for teenagers. I recommend this little picture to you and give it ** 1/2.
**** = A must see film. *** = Excellent show. Look for it. ** = Average movie. Kind of enjoyable. * = Poor show. Don't waste your money. 0 = Totally and painfully unbearable picture.
