Titles for films serve a variety of purposes from grabbing the attention of potential viewers to giving them an expectation of what the movie will be like. (Sometimes, of course, filmmakers confuse the public by devising ironic titles like HAPPINESS.)
The aptly named AN AFFAIR OF LOVE was originally called UNE LIAISON PORNOGRAPHIQUE (A PORNOGRAPHIC AFFAIR) when it was released in France. Both titles are true to the story, but A PORNOGRAPHIC AFFAIR is very misleading. Those people who go expecting graphic sex will be quite disappointed, and those avoiding it because they think it is a porn movie will be deprived of seeing an extremely wise and interesting movie about adult relationships. The story has more in common with MY DINNER WITH ANDRÉ than BASIC INSTINCT.
Let me explain.
The movie starts with an off-screen interviewer (Jacques Viala) talking independently with "him" (Sergi López) and "her" (Nathalie Baye) about the relationship that they once had with each other. (The two lead characters are known only by pronouns. We know that they are both single but know little more about them.) They have slightly different memories of their affair's frequency and duration. Although from the beginning we know the story's arc, writer Philippe Blasband finds involving and sometimes surprising ways to get there. Blasband comes up with an especially satisfying way to cause the affair to begin to unravel.
Their affair starts with her putting an ad in a sexual magazine for a man to have a purely physical affair, a.k.a., a pornographic affair, with her. He answers the ad, and they go to a hotel room which she has booked in advance. They both call what they have their "fantasy." What exactly this constitutes we'll never know for we are mainly confined to hanging around the hallway with the maid after they lock themselves in their room. This leaves us to concentrate on the non-sexual part of their union.
Both actors accomplish more with subtle facial movements than through their dialog. Well cast, the two middle-age actors are reasonably attractive but neither is beautiful. The chemistry between them, which we witness usually as they have drinks at a bar near the hotel, is more genuine that 20 such would-be romances in traditional Hollywood films. Their relationship moves from a business associate-like politeness to genuine love, but the road is anything but smooth, especially since they agree to divulge nothing of their private lives to each other, not even their names.
One of the most satisfying parts of the film occurs when they finally let us into their bedroom to watch them engage in sex, albeit not their fantasy act. Most cinematic sex has naked model-quality individuals engaging in something that approximates auditions for World Wrestling Federation membership. In contrast, director Frédéric Fonteyne has his actors truly making love, not sport. A minor quibble would be their constant use of sheets to cover themselves. A little more openness would have been appropriate.
What exactly was this fantasy of theirs, the interviewer demands to know. He will say nothing. She will only say that "it was an act of love." And love is precisely what AN AFFAIR OF LOVE is about -- as well as the importance of good human communication, friendship, intimacy and even marriage. It's a wonderfully touching film with a big and slightly bittersweet heart.
AN AFFAIR OF LOVE runs an amazingly fast 1:20. The film is in French with English subtitles. It is rated R for some strong sexual content and would be acceptable for older teenagers.
