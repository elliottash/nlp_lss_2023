Death, using the pseudonym of Joe Black and played with maximum charm by Brad Pitt, has come to earth to collect another soul. This time his pickup is supposed to be the extremely wealthy and wonderful man named William "Bill" Parrish, played with inviting sophistication by the great Anthony Hopkins.
In MEET JOE BLACK, director Martin Brest's remake of DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY from 1934, the eminently likeable Death decides to take a holiday. Rather than scurrying back to heaven, he decides to stay awhile on earth and see what it's like, so he expropriates Brad Pitt's body for the purpose -- something just about everyone would like to do.
MEET JOE BLACK is an incredible movie that doesn't fit neatly into any genre. Certainly it is a wonderful romance -- think date movie of the year, but it is much more that that. At times it can be extremely poignant, at other times it is wise, and it is always interlaced with intelligent and delicious comedy.
One thing is certain, the casting is superb. Brad Pitt, showing a gift for subtle, physical comedy, delivers the best performance of his career. He deserves Oscar consideration although he will probably be ignored since the role doesn't have the maudlin seriousness that the Academy frequently prefers.
The camera loves Pitt. With his golden blonde, perfectly unkempt hair, his deep blue eyes, and his bewitching smile, he mesmerizes the audience. The distinguished Hopkins is equally handsome, albeit a few decades older.
Cast opposite these two celestial stars is Claire Forlani as Susan Parrish, Bill's younger and extremely attractive daughter. Susan is a young medical intern who falls head over heels in love with Joe -- who wouldn't?
The story starts a few days before Bill's 65th birthday. Bill's older daughter Allison (Marcia Gay Harden) is busy spending her every waking hour obsessing over her elaborate plans for Bill's big birthday party. She is married to a self-proclaimed perennial loser named Quince, played likeably by Jeffrey Tambor.
When death shows up in Pitt's body, Bill christens him Joe Black for lack of a better name. Joe makes a bargain with Bill. He will let Bill live for a while longer if he can tag along with him everywhere and try out those earthly delights he's always heard about.
Pitt plays the part as a spectacular cipher. Like an alien from outer space, Joe doesn't know how to comport himself. When introduced to Bill's family at dinner, he just stares at them and smells his food.
Eventually, in an excursion to the kitchen, Joe samples peanut butter from a jar that the butler has open. He becomes so infatuated with this, his first taste experience, that he keeps asking for peanut butter. Much later, in Susan's arms, he will finally encounter an experience that surpasses even peanut butter.
Joe, who thoroughly enjoys his time on our planet, sees life as a wondrously funny adventure.
The story's main subplot has Susan's would-be husband, Drew (Jake Weber), trying to merge Bill's company with another, a move Bill comes to oppose. In a board meeting, Drew mentions that something is "as certain as death and taxes." A slightly offended and perplexed Joe muses, "Death and taxes? That's an odd pairing."
Joe, who is clueless about most human endeavors, is given some cash by Bill so he can get around town on his own. "You know about money, don't you?" Bill asks, not quite sure. "You can't buy happiness?" Joe replies with his usual big, innocent smile.
When Bill worries too much, Joe gets concerned since his time among the living is limited by Bill's health. "Easy Bill, you'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation," Joe warns.
In film that sets a new standard for tranquility, thanks to the director's methodical, dreamy pacing, its few tragedies are so striking that your heart may miss a few beats. Still, the overall feeling that will probably remain with you is a completely contented and romantic one.
Exquisitely filmed by Emmanuel Lubezki, the movie almost manages to make its three-hour length unnoticeable. In its last 45 minutes, the movie starts to end several times but keeps not quite finishing. When the ending, which does take too long in coming, arrives, it is spectacular. Like the rest of the film, it is funny, poignant, romantic and downright perfect. The last scene is even set to fireworks.
MEET JOE BLACK runs 2:57. It is rated PG-13 for sexuality, death, and a little profanity and would be fine for kids around 12 an up.
