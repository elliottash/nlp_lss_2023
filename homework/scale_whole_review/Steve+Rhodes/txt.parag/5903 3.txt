This weekend I saw JURASSIC PARK. I would give the dinos a **** rating as I never thought they were models or simulations and I will never forgot the awe inspiring sounds they made. As for the actors, director and especially the script, I would give them a * rating. Overall I give the movie a *** rating and wish the dinosaurs would have eaten all of the people except for say a narrator in the first 5 minutes of the show.
On the other hand, if they had created people I cared about, well then I would have preferred them to live and interacted with the dinos. Since I did not care if the people lived or died, the movie never scared me unlike Aliens (****) which scared the daylights out of me.
Now, what really bothered me in JURASSIC PARK were the stereotypes. We learned that complex systems are created by single programmers who are obese, live on candy bars, can single handed write 2 million lines of code, are exploited by evil managers, and are ready to kill everyone to make their fortune. Doesn't sound like any of my friends.
Like all good Hollywood produced movies with business people in them we again learn that they are out to make a PROFIT (boo, hiss ...). Making a profit we are reminded means that you must put your workers in physical jeopardy, underpay them, and most of all rape the ecohsystem.
**** = One of the top few films of this or any year. A must see film. *** = Excellent show. Look for it. ** = Average movie. Kind of enjoyable. * = Poor show. Don't waste your money. 0 = One of the worst films of this or any year. Totally unbearable.
