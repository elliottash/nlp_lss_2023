Bahman Farmanara's SMELL OF CAMPHOR, FRAGRANCE OF JASMINE, tells the story of an aging filmmaker, Bahman Farjami (Bahman Farmanara), who for 20 years has been forbidden by the Iranian government from making films. Described by some as an Iranian Woody Allen, Farmanara is more of a poignantly tragic comedian. When Farjami confronts life's insults, from a doctor who wants him to eat only things that taste bad to his own grave plot being sold before he take up residence, his reaction is palpable injury, shown more in the scowl on his face than in his words. Farmanara gives the story's best line, "Abstinence is the best diet," not to himself, but to a minor character, Farjami's doctor. With its references to Poe and Dickens, this slice of the end of a man's life strikes universal themes. As you might guess, the film has certain autobiographical elements in that Farmanara was himself kept for 20 years from making films.
SMELL OF CAMPHOR, FRAGRANCE OF JASMINE runs 1:33. The film is in Persian with English subtitles. It is not rated but might be PG for mature themes.
