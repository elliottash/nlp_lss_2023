In Christian Otjen's film noir, LADY IN THE BOX, Jerry (Darren Burrows, "Northern Exposure") has a problem. He just earned $500 from a stranger named Doug (Mark Sheppard) for dumping a trunk into the lake. When Jerry gets back to his apartment, he finds blood stains everywhere and hair with scalp attached on his kitchen floor. Since his girlfriend is nowhere to be found, you can guess what he assumes was in the heavy trunk. After all, the movie isn't titled BRICKS IN THE BOX.
The fear on Jerry's face is palpable. His best friend Chris (Robert Knepper) points out how dumb Jerry was, since the newspapers have been full of stories about two recently murdered young women. Confirming Jerry's fears, Doug comes back with some frightening demands. From there, it's one twist and turn after another. The performances by the three guys are quite good, but the story suffers from having been told so often. One key revelation is too easily guessed, and the movie has trouble with its last act. The final twist, however, is devilishly fun.
LADY IN THE BOX runs 1:44. It is not rated but would be an R for violence and language and would be acceptable for most teenagers.
