"Instead of searching for the meaning of life, our story starts with the search for air-conditioning," our narrator sternly informs us. James and his two buddies, Steffan and Fuquan, are beating the heat by taking in a movie. In a major inspirational moment, James realizes that he could make a better movie than the one that they're watching. After spending an entire day writing the script for his magnum opus, a movie about the life of famous radical Angela Davis, he's ready. The only thing left is to cast the part of Angela -- via musical auditions -- and secure funding.
Doug E. Doug, from the "Cosby" TV series, produces, directs, co-writes and stars in CITIZEN JAMES, an irreverent, hip and good-spirited movie about James, a young filmmaker who, like Doug, is off to make his first movie. James, a broke resident of the projects in Bedford Stuyvesant, tries to get financial assistance from renowned African-American filmmaker, Bleep Lee. (Whenever anyone says the name Spike Lee, some sound has been added in postproduction to cover the word Spike. It is a transparent joke since Bleep Lee's production company is also called 40 Acres, and Bleep Lee looks similar to Spike Lee. Every time they use this wink at the audience, it's cute.)
Filmed in grainy black and white, the picture has the look of a gritty 1950's drama set in one of the New York City boroughs. But CITIZEN JAMES never takes itself too seriously. Many of the jokes don't click but those do make for an entertaining time. It's a promising first effort for Doug as a filmmaker.
CITIZEN JAMES runs a breezy 1:16. It is not rated but would be an R for language and would be acceptable for most teenagers.
