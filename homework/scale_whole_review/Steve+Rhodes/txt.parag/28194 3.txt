JOE DIRT, which has the second worst trailer this year (FREDDY GOT FINGERED's are even worse), is pretty much what you'd expect from a movie produced by Adam Sandler. Full of bathroom humor, food fights and humping dogs, it's the kind of movie beloved by its target audience and correctly shunned by others.
Starring David Spade, who shares the writing "credits" with Fred Wolf, the movie concerns a boy abandoned by his parents when he was 8. A guy who is treated like his last name, Joe has spent the last 15 years trying to find the folks who "lost" him. Speaking of lost, Spade, last seen starring in LOST & FOUND, which I regretfully found, was worse then than in JOE DIRT.
Joe tells his life story in flashback to LA radio talk show host Zander Kelly (Dennis Miller), as LA waits with bated breath by the radio. Although Kelly maligns Dirt, calling him "exquisitely pathetic" and "a white trash idiot," Dirt just keeps dishing out his story to Kelly's eager audience. Eventually, Kelly grows to respect his guest, upgrading his status to "white trash treasure."
In one of his stories, Dirt is literally "covered in crap." The movie is like that. Last week's TOMCATS is a comedic masterpiece next to JOE DIRT.
JOE DIRT runs 1:26. It is rated PG-13 for crude, sex-related humor and language and would be acceptable for teenagers.
