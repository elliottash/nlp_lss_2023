SET IT OFF is a warmed over THELMA AND LOUISE story full of cliched racial stereotypes. The whites discriminate and oppress while the blacks drink heavily, smoke dope, and rob banks. Both groups are highly proficient in killing each other.
Takashi Bufford and Kate Lanier's manipulative script tries to make you care for the hard working members from the projects, but it overstates its case so badly that it loses most of its credibility. SET IT OFF is a high energy show featuring lots of automatic weapons and flying bullets. The action rarely lags, and you need only wait short intervals before another scene will do something to try to shock you.
Frankie (Vivica Fox from INDEPENDENCE DAY) is a recently promoted teller at a bank. As the show opens, her cheery day takes a turn for the worse when Darnell, an acquaintance from the projects, comes to her station. She tells him that she is surprised he has enough money to have a bank account.
Darnell and his friends are there to rob the bank. The heist goes bad and people on both sides have their blood splatter all over each other. After the hailstorm of bullets subside, Darnell and company make their exit.
Darnell runs square into rule number one when robbing banks. If you rob a bank, do not have initials carved into your hairdo. Cops like hints like that. Remember, those little video cameras aren't there for nothing.
"What's the proper procedure for dealing with this situation?" asks Detective Strode (John C. McGinley) about what Frankie should have done in the stickup. Blood splattered Frankie does not pass this kangaroo court in her boss's office after the robbery so he fires her on the spot. This is one of many contrived and unbelievable sequences. Never does she think about complaining about her rights or threatening to sue.
Frankie takes a night job as a janitor along with her friends, a tough lesbian named Cleo (Queen Latifah), a single mom named Tisean (Kimberly Elise), and a woman named Stony (Jada Pinkett from THE NUTTY PROFESSOR) who has a kid brother having problems getting into UCLA. The women work in a huge and lavish office building full of chrome and glass which is the exact opposite of the environment where they live. They pick up the photos on the desks and ridicule the workers there as having it so much easier that they do. One woman in the picture, for example, they say clearly doesn't wash any dishes.
These woman have problems with everyone. Their manager at Luther's Janitorial Service promised them under the table money but reneges on the deal rationalizing it with, "There are three people in this world I don't mess with: the I., the R., and the S." After this, one of them goes back to the projects to rent her body to raise cash.
One day, on top of a roof while drinking from open bottles and smoking dope, they concoct their big scheme. "If crackhead Darnell can rob a bank, we can." From there, the film takes fairly standard twists and turns. It includes scenes of police circling the wrong black man and viciously mowing him down with automatic weapons. The part is lifted straight out of the ending sequence of BONNIE AND CYLDE.
SET IT OFF has potential. These women have real problems, but director F. Gary Gray goes for exploitation so much that the audience is left with only the action to enjoy. I suppose people who like hating cops or one of the ethnic groups in the show might also gain some vicarious pleasure since everyone is shown in a bad light. In a time when the country should be trying to come together, I found this picture to be a celebration of our divisions. Sad.
SET IT OFF runs a full 2:00 for no good reason. It is rated R for very graphic violence, bad language, sex, and drug usage. I would just as soon no one saw the picture, but if teenagers go, they should be quite mature. I did not like the film and do not recommend it. I give this mean spirited film a single *.
**** = One of the top few films of this or any year. A must see film. *** = Excellent show. Look for it. ** = Average movie. Kind of enjoyable. * = Poor show. Don't waste your money. 0 = One of the worst films of this or any year. Totally unbearable.
