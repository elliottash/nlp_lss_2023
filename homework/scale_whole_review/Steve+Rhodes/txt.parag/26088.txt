MONARCH is an atmospheric tale of plotting and intrigue set during one of those classic dark and stormy nights. This "god-forsaken night" occurs during the last year of the reign of Britain's King Henry VIII in 1547. Having the claustrophobic feel of a filmed play, which it apparently is not, the movie takes place within the confines of a few sparsely furnished rooms of a large manor house, which is surprisingly guarded by only one young man, Will (Mark Montgomerie).
Written, directed, produced and edited by John Walsh, the movie creates handsome images but has trouble crafting a compelling story. The plot has the aged king being attacked, injured and taken to the manor house. Since only the king is hurt and no money is taken, the six aides who accompany him assume that it must have been a failed assassination attempt.
These six aides are quintessential court schemers. Lurking in the shadows of the house they speculate on who is plotting against whom about what. Looking similar and dressed in identical black robes, the actors play almost interchangeable parts. Jean Marsh, in Henry's hallucinations, shows up in a cameo as the amalgamation of all of his wives.
At one point the movie looks like it may turn into something akin to THE TEN LITTLE INDIANS, but, alas, it is never that exciting. Instead, the movie just drifts until daybreak ends the story. Most of the movie is as obvious as its metaphors. "There is always something rotten at the core," one of the king's aides tells Will after they make him bite into a worm-infested apple.
Although it is handsomely filmed and reasonably acted, the movie's most memorable moments come from the rain and wind. It's not a good sign when the best parts of a drama are the sound effects.
MONARCH runs 1:39. It is not rated but would be an R for a few scenes of violence. It would be acceptable for most teenagers.
