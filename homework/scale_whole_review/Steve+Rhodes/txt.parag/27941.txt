GET OVER IT, by director Tommy O'Haver (BILLY HOLLYWOOD'S SCREEN KISS) and writer R. Lee Fleming, Jr. (SHE'S ALL THAT), suffers from a bad case of the two-movies-in-one syndrome. One movie is a promising, albeit unoriginal, teen romance in which Berke (Ben Foster) loves Allison (Melissa Sagemiller), who has broken up with him in order to date a more popular kid, Striker (Shane West), a former member of a boy band. All the while, Berke stays good friends with Kelly (Kirsten Dunst, BRING IT ON), who would be a much better choice for him if he would just realize it.
The second movie is a traditional crude teen comedy complete with a horse who urinates profusely on a guy's face and a dog who has sex with every inanimate object he passes. A bad Martin Short -- Is there any other lately? -- chews up the scenery as an obnoxious high school play director who looks like Bobby Darren dressed as the devil. He says things like, "Me thinks thou better not botch it," to his cast. This second movie feels almost like an afterthought in order to obtain studio funding. The first movie doesn't deserve this crude level of humor.
Containing several imaginative dream sequences and a cute ending with a musical adaptation of Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream," GET OVER IT could have been a sweet little movie. Instead, we end up feeling sorry for the two likable leads, Foster and Dunst, who have to endure all of the story's failed attempts at making recycled bathroom humor funny.
GET OVER IT runs 1:25. It is rated PG-13 for some crude/sexual humor, teen drinking and language and would be acceptable for teenagers.
