Looking for the perfect wedding gift for Maggie Verver (Kate Beckinsale), his soon-to-be bride, Italian Prince Amerigo (Jeremy Northam) and his current lover, Charlotte Stant (Uma Thurman), pick out a magnificent golden bowl in the movie based on the classic Henry James novel of manners and intrigue, "The Golden Bowl." When the prince points out that the bowl has an almost imperceptible flaw, they decide to postpone its purchase.
The story revolves around relationships that look perfect but aren't, just like the bowl. Carrying the bowl metaphor a bit further, this exquisite motion picture itself has a few imperfections, including being about 10 minutes too long. More disconcerting is Jeremy Northam's jarring Italian accent which feels just as fake as his beard, which may be genuine but doesn't look it. Still, these are minor quibbles.
THE GOLDEN BOWL is brought to the screen by the famous Merchant-Ivory team which includes producer Ismail Merchant, director James Ivory, screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, cinematographer Tony Pierce-Roberts, composer Richard Robbins and costumer John Bright. Their movies always look terrific. Sometimes, as in THE ROOM WITH A VIEW, they let the look overwhelm the story, but other times, as in THE REMAINS OF THE DAY and THE GOLDEN BOWL, they come up with a story that's more than a match for the production's lush appearance.
Several decades ago, the BBC did a mini-series of "The Golden Bowl," which was shown on Masterpiece Theater in America -- the prince, by the way, notes that he is a direct descendant of Amerigo Vespucci from whence the word America is derived. This television series is a personal favorite of mine, and, even if this film version doesn't quite measure up, it is a wonderful movie in its own right.
Starting in 1903, the movie spans a decade in which the prince does make a princess out of Maggie, who is the daughter of America's first billionaire, Adam Verver (Nick Nolte), a widower. Although Charlotte would have been happy to marry the prince, he wisely points out that they are both broke so they must marry money. Charlotte comes to realize the value of his advice when she marries Adam. The real reason for her marriage, however, is to be closer to the prince since Maggie is a childish woman who is joined at the hip to her father. The father and daughter go everywhere together, leaving their respective spouses with too much time alone. Of course, being the generous and caring people that they are, Adam and Maggie insist that the prince keep Charlotte company. Bad idea.
In this story of who knows what and when, the real intrigue stems from the characters' actions. Who will first break the silence and say honestly what is on his or her mind? And who will forever speak only in euphemisms? Even after Maggie knows of her husband's infidelity, she tells Charlotte with something sounding like complete sincerity, "I have never thought you anything you but beautiful, wonderful and good." It rather reminds one of the time that George McGovern said that he was "1,000 percent" behind his vice-presidential running mate and then dumped him like a hot potato right afterwards. One thing is certain, there are lots of truthfully good things to say about this superb motion picture from the strong ensemble cast to the striking production to the mesmerizing yet delicate story.
THE GOLDEN BOWL runs 2:10. It is rated R for a brief sex scene without nudity. The movie would be acceptable for kids around 12 or 13 and up.
