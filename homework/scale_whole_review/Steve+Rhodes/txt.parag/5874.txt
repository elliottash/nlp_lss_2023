Now, I would give the firm 2 1/2 stars. Only if you have NOT read the book, would I recommend the movie; otherwise, I would say skip it.
I found the movie simple and easy to follow. I thought the casting was just about perfect in that everyone in the show reminded me of the characters from the book. Although granted there were some changes, I thought overall the movie was a good subset of the book. I thought the movie was well directed and edited. The visuals and the sound were nothing special but were okay.
Now, why if I loved the book and I thought this was very similar to the book would I give it only a so-so review? The reason the book was so great was the suspense and the page-turner writing style. After reading the book, there were no surprises. A big ho-hum.
If you have not read the book, you might just love this show. If I had not read the book, I think it might have gotten as high as 3 to 3 1/2 stars from me.
**** = One of the top few films of this or any year. A must see film. *** = Excellent show. Look for it. ** = Average movie. Kind of enjoyable. * = Poor show. Don't waste your money. 0 = One of the worst films of this or any year. Totally unbearable.
