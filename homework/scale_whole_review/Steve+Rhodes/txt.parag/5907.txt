Saw THE PIANO (***) on Friday night. If you thought how wonderful it would be living in New Zealand a hundred years ago, this movie will disabuse you of that notion. This is a dark and depressing show about the evils of life. Depressing shows can be quite rewarding as this film proves.
Holly Hunter without her Southern or any accent (she does not talk) nevertheless gives an award winning performance. She is one of my favorite actresses. Her best for me will always be BROADCAST NEWS.
Sam Neill is very good as a husband with an IQ about equal to his age. He was mean yet somehow you managed to feel sorry for him at times because he just did not seem to have the brains to know better. Harvey Keitel was excellent as the, well, as the boy friend I guess you might say.
I wish they had ended the show in a slightly different way a few minutes before it actually ended. If you see the show, you will know where I mean.
DO go see it, but don't expect sweetness and light.
**** = One of the top few films of this or any year. A must see film. *** = Excellent show. Look for it. ** = Average movie. Kind of enjoyable. * = Poor show. Don't waste your money. 0 = One of the worst films of this or any year. Totally unbearable.
