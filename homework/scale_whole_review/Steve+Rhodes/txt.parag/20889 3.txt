Satoshi Kon's PERFECT BLUE gives an entirely new meaning to the term "cartoon violence." Featuring multiple realistic rapes, gory stabbings, mutilations, sex and full-frontal nudity, this animated feature from Japan hails from the Brian de Palma school of excess. Needless to say, it's not for kids. And I would go further to argue that it's not for most adults either since it's level of writing is beneath them.
Sadayuki Mura's script, which is dubbed into English, might not have been so ridiculous in its native language, but one suspects it was. Why they had someone with a heavy US Southern accent dub the part of the Japanese mother is a mystery.
A confession is in order. This style of Japanese animation is called "anime," and PERFECT BLUE is the first example of that art form that I can remember seeing. Whether this one is typical or not I cannot say, I am only reviewing this particular film and not the genre.
Although the drawing in PERFECT BLUE is colorful, it is as flat and lifeless as a typical Saturday morning television cartoon. The action is created mainly by panning the camera across the canvas and making some of the characters' lips move slightly. The resulting two-dimensional look is particularly uninviting.
The story concerns the life of a self-described "pop idol," named Mima Kirigoe. Mima, a member of a Spice Girls type singing group, decides to leave the group to become an actress. Being an actress means that she has to act out stripper scenes, rape scenes, etc. It's a rough life, but she's willing to do it in order to advance her career.
Someone begins to stalk Mima. The stranger starts killing those around her as he gets ever closer to her. The story is told with the old trick of sequences that look real but which turn out to be fantasies and vice versa. If Mima wasn't such a twit, one might have been able to care about her some. This is a girl who has a cordless phone, a TV and a FAX in her bedroom but doesn't even know what the word "Internet" means.
There is probably an audience for PERFECT BLUE, but I can't figure out what the demographics would be. It's too dumb for adults and too violent for kids. Go figure.
PERFECT BLUE runs a tortuously long 1:20. It is not rated but would be an R for strong violence, rape, gore, strong sexuality and nudity. It would be acceptable for teenagers only if they are older and mature.
