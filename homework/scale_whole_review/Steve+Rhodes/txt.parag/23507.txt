How about this for a concept? An autobiographical story about a boy and his dog that doesn't have any special effects, no talking animals and no promotional toy tie-ins. Jay Russell's MY DOG SKIP is just a good, old-fashioned, heart-warming story that is so genuine and touching that it should appeal to people of all ages, even those with no kids.
"My fondest memories are of my childhood days back in Yazoo, Mississippi," Willie Morris explains to us in voice-over in the introduction. Set during the summer of 1942, as WW II rages, the story concerns 9-year-old Willie (Frankie Muniz from "Malcolm in the Middle"), a scrawny kid with a small mouth and beady eyes, who gets picked on by the local bullies.
On his birthday, Willie receives Skip, a precious, terrier puppy, as a gift from his mother (Diane Lane), but his father (Kevin Bacon) doesn't approve. His father lost his leg in the Spanish Civil war. He's a good dad but a cautious one, who appears to still be suffering from unspoken war wounds.
The sweetest little dog imaginable, Skip is a lovable pup who's full of energy. The director finds lots of adorable things for the canine to do without ever letting the story turn schmaltzy. Typical of the inspired staging is the delightful, time-lapse visual of Skip as he is growing up until he is finally big enough to jump up and drink from the family's white porcelain toilet bowl.
"The dog of your boyhood teaches you a great deal," Willie tells us of Skip. "You could talk to him better than you could talk to most human beings." Skip is truly Willie's best friend, the most loyal of loyal companions.
"Like all dogs, Skip was color blind," Willie says of the dog's companionship with races on both sides of the track in the typically segregated, Southern town. The movie is filled with touching subplots from one about racism to one about the disgraced town hero, Dink Jenkins (Luke Wilson). Dink, a star high-school athlete, worshiped by the locals, especially the young boys, is emotionally scarred by the war.
The movie is filled with wonderfully poetic narration by Harry Connick, Jr., as the voice of the adult Willie. "Why in childhood and youth do we wish time to pass quickly, and as an adult we wish just the opposite?" he asks. "All the lessons you learn in childhood kind of come in waves," he tells us. And this was the summer that Willie learned quite a few. Many of the episodes are quite humorous, and all are honest and genuine.
The warmly nostalgic picture is filmed in radiantly inviting colors and filled with richly evocative music.
As a viewer, you will vicariously get to enjoy Skip's friendship. And if you find yourself both applauding and crying during the picture, as I did, don't be surprised. Actually, if you don't cry, you'll probably want to get a check-up.
The film joyously reminds us all of just how wonderful life can be. The good-spirited picture will likely bring back many fond memories of your childhood. I too had a terrier, although mine was half cocker spaniel. Willie describes himself as an only child with an only dog, which was exactly my situation as well. There are other similarities, but I can't mention them without giving away key plot points. I relived my childhood while watching the film. What more could you ask for?
MY DOG SKIP runs 1:35. It is rated PG for some violent content and mild language. The film would be fine for all ages, including people without kids at all. Be warned, however, that some of the tragedies in the picture may briefly frighten impressionable kids under around 8.
My son Jeffrey, age 10, absolutely adored the movie. He gave it **** and said that it should win an Oscar. He liked everything about the movie, and he loved Skip. Jeffrey's buddy Nickolas, age 10, gave the picture ***, saying it was funny and had a good plot. And, of course, he too thought Skip was terrific.
