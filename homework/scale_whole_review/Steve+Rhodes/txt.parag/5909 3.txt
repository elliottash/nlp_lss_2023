A one phrase review of THE CEMENT GARDEN would be that it is LORD OF THE FLIES meets HAROLD AND MAUDE. This is an unrated show, but could be NC-17.
I have trouble writing G rated reviews of NC-17 class movies. Let me say the film involves solo sex, incest, death of parents, stale bodies and other activities. By now you probably get the basic idea.
This is a film that is better seen that described. It features some great acting. In the cast are the children: Andrew Robertson as Jack, Charlotte Gainsbourg as Julie, Alice Coulthard as Sue, Ned Birkin as Tom; the parents Sinead Cusack as Mother and Hanns Zischler as Father; and Jochen Horst as Julie's friend Derek.
The script is excellent and full of surprises. If you can enjoy quirky shows, this may just be your cup of tea. Personally, I liked it a lot and gave it ***.
**** = One of the top few films of this or any year. A must see film. *** = Excellent show. Look for it. ** = Average movie. Kind of enjoyable. * = Poor show. Don't waste your money. 0 = One of the worst films of this or any year. Totally unbearable.
