"We're trying to make a movie here, not a film," explains Bobby Bowfinger (Steve Martin), head of Bowfinger International Pictures. Bobby, whose recent films include THE YUGO STORY, is a no nonsense filmmaker. In possession now of a great script by his accountant and part-time receptionist, Bobby has only one problem. In order to turn the script -- CHUBBY RAIN, about aliens falling to earth in fat raindrops -- into a "go picture," he just needs famous action hero Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) to star in it.
Superstar Kit doesn't give small-potatoes producer Bobby the time of day, forcing Bobby to improvise. He will resort to guerilla filmmaking techniques and shoot Kit's scenes from hidden cameras. Kit will never know he's in the movie, and most of CHUBBY RAIN's cast and crew don't know that Kit doesn't know. ("Did you know that Tom Cruise had no idea he was in that vampire movie until two years later?" Bobby tells his cameraman.)
The inventive and resourceful Bobby has an answer for every problem. Need some lighting for a shot? Just have a guy on the street hold a reflective "Work for Food" sign and use the sun to illuminate Kit's face.
Frank Oz, who gave us the riotously funny IN AND OUT (one of the best movies of 1997), directs BOWFINGER with near perfection. As they did in DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS, Oz and Martin form a great team. Together with Murphy and a scene-stealing Heather Graham (AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME), the cast and crew of BOWFINGER are as wonderful as those in CHUBBY RAIN are humorously appalling.
Steve Martin's script is a classic bit of comedic writing with a long list of memorable lines. The most amazing part of the script is that it gets laughs the old-fashioned way without benefit of flatulence jokes, bathroom humor or bodily fluids.
The movie deliciously skewers Tinseltown. Bobby reveals such secrets as the fact that every movie costs exactly $2,184 -- which is what he has saved away. Everything above that sum is overhead in the forms of gross points, mark-ups, etc. With this sum he hires "the best damn crew we can afford," which means they go to the border and collect some free illegal aliens.
In the story's best subplot, Daisy (Graham) plays a would-be starlet from the Midwest who's given herself one week to hit it big in movieland. She's a fast learner. "I may be from Ohio," she explains. "But, I'm not from Ohio." She realizes quickly the tried and true method for a young actress to advance her career overnight -- figuring out the right people to sleep with. Daisy's so bright and fast, that she flits from partner to partner, rapidly moving up the food chain. Graham, with her pixyish grin and her girl-next-door sexuality is the perfect choice for the role. She takes what could be a slightly sleazy part and turns it into a sweet and charming one instead. "Who cares if when I reach my sexual peak, you'll be 70," Daisy tells Bobby with sincere conviction as they frolic in bed.
Murphy shows an acting dexterity and a risk-taking openness that's impressive. As Kit, he dares to be unsure of himself and completely paranoid. As Jiff, a shy guy who would be happy to work his way up to gofer, Murphy, with bad teeth and braces, plays a second part. When they can't find Kit for a while, Jiff is hired to film some of Kit's scenes. Jiff blushes or cries, not as an act, but because he's embarrassed or scared.
In Jiff's interview, Bobby probes whether Jiff would be willing to alter his appearance in order to look like Kit. "Would you be willing to cut your hair?" Bobby probes. "Yes, but it's usually better if someone else does it," Jiff replies sincerely, missing the point of the question entirely. He does have movie experience; he says that he's a frequent renter at Blockbuster.
Another subplot pokes fun at stars' fascination with Scientology, called Mind Head in the movie and led by an ethereal Terry Stricter (Terence Stamp, Chancellor Valorum from STAR WARS: EPISODE I). As CHUBBY RAIN's actors keep coming up to him talking about aliens, Kit becomes neurotic and unbalanced. Kit flees to his guru, Terry, who peppers him with aphorisms. Kit should mean "Keep It Together," Kit repeats to himself with little confidence. After volumes of useless pop advice, Terry eventually realizes what's happening to Kit. "It seems the paranoid sometimes are actually being followed," Terry concludes.
As the movie advances towards a climax worthy of CHARIOTS OF FIRE, the energetic pacing reaches fever pitch. In a sort of epilogue, we get to glimpse Bobby's next movie, which is so outrageously bad that an uncontrollable fit of laughter is the most likely response. BOWFINGER and both of the movies within it are thoroughly satisfying. Even if they charged you for all three, it would be worth the triple admission price.
BOWFINGER runs 1:37. It is rated PG-13 for sex-related material and language and would be fine for kids 10 and up.
My son Jeffrey, age 10, thought the movie was hilarious and gave it a full ****. His favorite part was the high-spirited ending.
