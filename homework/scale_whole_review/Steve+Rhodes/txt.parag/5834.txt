Having recently seen and survived, but just barely, the new movie FLIPPER with Paul Hogan (CROCODILE DUNDEE) and Elijah Wood (THE ADVENTURES OF HUCK FINN), we decided to rent the 1963 original movie which inspirited two TV series in addition to the remake.
Well, as outlandish and ridiculous as the remake is, the original manages to be slightly worse. The original is a somnolent little treatise on the minutia of living near the ocean. Careful never to offend anyone and taking absolutely no risks, the show meanders until is finally put to sleep by a benevolent editor (Warren Adams).
Director James B. Clark's specialty is children's B movies, having directed such unmemorable films as A DOG OF FLANDERS, ISLAND OF THE BLUE DOLPHINS, MY SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN, and THE LITTLE ARK. Here he makes his only well known film, and why it was so successful is beyond this critic. Yes, the dolphin star is photogenic, but he gets much less screen time the actors.
Since there really is no plot, a summary seems superfluous, but let me tell you all you need to know. Around 10 year old Sandy Ricks (Luke Halpin) lives with his fisherman father Porter (Chuck Connors from the "Rifleman" TV show) and his mother Martha (Kathleen Maquire) near the ocean.
As the show starts, Kim Parker (Connie Scott) has just come to visit. Sandy tells her sincerely, "Your lucky, a hurricane on your first visit." Needless to say, the big storm sounds ferocious but its effects are fairly tame.
To the extent that anything occurs in the show, it has to do with Flipper's being speared by a bad kid, rescued by Sandy, and then later saving Sandy from sharks in return. Most scenes are of little consequence. Typical is the one where Sandy is working in the yard and tossing balls to Flipper.
The music (Henry Vars) sounds straight out of one of those Disney Living Desert TV documentaries. Most of the show is dominated by the loud violins whose sole purpose seems to be to anesthetize the audience. The song during the show proclaims loudly that, "Flipper lives in a world full of wonder." Perhaps he does, but not in this show.
Other than Flipper, who is cute, the only other aspect of the film with any merit is the cinematography by Lamar Boren and Joseph Brun. They produce warm pastel shades that give a surreal and yet nostalgic look to the sets.
FLIPPER runs 1:27. It is not rated, but would get a G today. There is no sex, nudity, or even mildly offensive language. The violence is confined to the hurricane hitting, a spear into Flipper and Flipper's shark fight. Jeffrey (age seven) says he recommends it to kids four and up, but feels that the shark and hurricane scenes may be too intense for younger kids. He actually likes the original better than the remake, which he also likes. I hate them both, but if forced at gunpoint to watch one of them again, I'd go for the remake. At least it takes some risks and has a few imaginative scenes. I give the original just barely one *.
**** = One of the top few films of this or any year. A must see film. *** = Excellent show. Look for it. ** = Average movie. Kind of enjoyable. * = Poor show. Don't waste your money. 0 = One of the worst films of this or any year. Totally unbearable.
