Last night I saw A DANGEROUS WOMAN starring Barbara Hershey, Gabriel Byrne, and most of all Debra Winger. I gave the movie 2 stars. I liked it but could not recommend it.
A DANGEROUS WOMAN had very poor directing by Stephen Gyllenhaal. Overall the show was a mess. You could fall asleep in parts it went so slow. You may remember Gyllenhaal from all of the TV movies he has directed. Perhaps you saw his awful PARIS TROUT on TV.
What was good about A DANGEROUS WOMAN was Debra Winger's part. She played someone who the doctors could find nothing wrong with but who suffered from an extremely low IQ.
The movie centered around Winger's sexuality. She gave an absolutely wonderful performance. Very realistic. I wish she had a better director. The other people in the movie were acceptable but nothing special.
There is one scene in the movie that was more chilling than any horror show. Best to close your eyes and hold your ears - it was frightening.
**** = One of the top few films of this or any year. A must see film. *** = Excellent show. Look for it. ** = Average movie. Kind of enjoyable. * = Poor show. Don't waste your money. 0 = One of the worst films of this or any year. Totally unbearable.
