First, let me be clear. Director Mike Figgis's MR. JONES (1993), staring Richard Gere as Mr. Jones, is an extremely hard show to watch. Think of it as paying $7 for a virtual reality game where you too can be a manic depressive and for two solid hours no less!
Second, the ending is awful. Third, the script writers (Michael Cristofer and Eric Roth) felt like they had to introduce an unbelievable love affair with the patient Mr. Jones and the psychiatrist Dr. Libbie Bowen (Lena Olin). Actually, for this bit of ridiculousness, I do thank them somewhat. Without it, the show was so intense it might have been totally unbearable. Finally, the title is terrible. Mr. Jones sounds like a love story or a light comedy.
Now, why in my right mind (no pun intended), would I recommend this show and give it a high rating (*** 1/2)? Two reasons. First, Gere performance, especially in his manic states, was pure academy award winning stuff. Second, it forces you, albeit very painfully, to come to grips with what depression is and even more so what manic depression is. Every time Gere got into his manic state, you felt like you had just popped a bottle of speed. This is one of those show you think about again and again for years.
**** = One of the top few films of this or any year. A must see film. *** = Excellent show. Look for it. ** = Average movie. Kind of enjoyable. * = Poor show. Don't waste your money. 0 = One of the worst films of this or any year. Totally unbearable.
