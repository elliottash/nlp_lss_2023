WHITE is a bitter sweet tragedy from Polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski. Although it is the middle part of his three color trilogy (BLUE has already been shown in the US and RED is coming), each movie stands totally on its own. The movie is in French and Polish with English subtitles.
In the opening scene, the husband (Zbigniew Zamachowski) is in court being divorced by his wife (Julie Delpy) on the grounds that he has been unable to consummate the marriage. This opening sequence leads quickly to the rest of the movie which is about his seeking fortune and about his attempting to get back at his cruel wife for divorcing him.
The script written by Krzysztof Kieslowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz has a few nice twists that are kind of hard to guess. The movie takes place mainly in Poland. Zamachowski's acting is good as the common man who was wronged. Delpy's acting consists of standing around and looking beautiful. Don't get me wrong she does a super job at that, but you do not need an actress to stand up and look terrific - they could have hired a fashion model.
The movie's feel is that of a short story made into a movie. The only real complaint I have, other than there is not much substance, is that I found the ending too abrupt. Perhaps Red will be better; I never got to see Blue.
The movie is rated R for reasons I can not figure out. It is clearly a PG-13 show. It runs 1:32 and has the real potential for putting you to sleep in parts. I give the movie * 1/2 for the acting of the male lead and some fun plot twists, but I can not recommend to anyone.
**** = One of the top few films of this or any year. A must see film. *** = Excellent show. Look for it. ** = Average movie. Kind of enjoyable. * = Poor show. Don't waste your money. 0 = One of the worst films of this or any year. Totally unbearable.
