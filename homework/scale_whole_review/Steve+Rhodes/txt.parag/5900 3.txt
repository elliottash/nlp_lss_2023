Movie Premise: Kennedy was killed because of Vietnam and almost every man, woman and child alive at the time was part of the conspiracy.
My short review: Sure.
My expanded review: Oliver Stone is a great movie director. Sometimes he lets his skill go to his head. This is a fine movie from a technical and an acting viewpoint. The problem is that it is all balderdash.
So I guess, I do recommend it, but why oh why can't he sprinkle in a little realism. I hate fantasies masquerading as reality.
**** = One of the top few films of this or any year. A must see film. *** = Excellent show. Look for it. ** = Average movie. Kind of enjoyable. * = Poor show. Don't waste your money. 0 = One of the worst films of this or any year. Totally unbearable.
