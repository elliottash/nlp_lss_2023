Psst! Can I interest you in some hot tattoos? As the beautiful Simona (Mercedes Ortega) dances by the big bonfire, her body, covered all over in tattoos, gets all warm and toasty.
Writer/director Jo Sol's TATAWO is about sex, nudity, drugs and, most of all, tattoos. There's probably a plot hidden somewhere beneath this tattoo-laden tale, but you couldn't prove it by me. When the characters speak, they are less than illuminating. "You're like embracing smoke," a character known as the Cuban (Alexis Valdés) tells his wife, whom he calls Bug (Paulina Gálvez).
About the only reason to see the film is for the eye candy. One of Simona's favorite pastimes is to undulate in the nude in a shop window. As haunting music plays, it is hard not to fall under the erotic spell that she weaves. But this is a transitory pleasure and does little to compensate for the dreadful dullness of the rest of the movie.
TATAWO runs a long 1:29. The film is in Spanish with English subtitles. It is not rated but would be an R for sex, nudity and drug usage and would be acceptable for high school seniors and older.
