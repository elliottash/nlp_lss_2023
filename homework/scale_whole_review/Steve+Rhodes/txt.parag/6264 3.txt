First, let's do a destination check. If you are looking for a sex show, then you've got the wrong movie - SWINGERS isn't it. Regardless of the title, which actually has a triple meaning in the film, SWINGERS is about a sweet character who broke up with his long time girlfriend six months ago, but can't get over it.
SWINGERS is a touching little film with an endearing performance by Jon Favreau as unlucky-at-love Mike. Favreau, with his strong chin and long sad face that looks like a rock statue, has just the physique to afford him the opportunity to play such roles for maximum empathy. Although the other actors in the show are okay, only his acting is compelling. Favreau also wrote and co-produced SWINGERS. Favreau's script and Doug Liman's direction are what makes this little tale come alive.
"You have to put life into perspective. She doesn't deserve you," says Mike's answer machine to him since his ex-girlfriend still hasn't called him. He has moved from the East Coast to LA and now hangs out with new male buddies who are all trying to break into the entertainment field. He is a wannabe comic, but most of all he is a wannabe boyfriend of somebody.
Most of the film is about his trying unsuccessfully to establish a relationship with someone of the opposite sex. His buddies have a plethora of advice, most about the correct time before calling back a woman you have just met. "Two days is like industry standard" advises his male friend named Sue (Patrick Van Horn). The proper interval is a subject of much debate among his den of male companions, who approach the topic with ferocity and precision.
His male clique's pseudo-sophistication provides most of the humor. There are few guffaws, but lots of nice episodes worthy of many a chuckle. Trent (Vince Vaughn), who claims a long string of female conquests, admits that he hasn't a clue as to what his girlfriends are talking about and "all I do is stare at their mouths and wrinkle my nose, and I turn out to be a sweetheart" to them.
His friends' careers are going nowhere like his own. When Rob (Ron Livingston) doesn't get his sitcom part, he tries out for a job as Goofy, but gets turned down because, "I didn't have any theme park experience."
The script is full of little quirky aspects. My favorite is that it reveals that all of the coolest bars in Hollywood are entered via unmarked doors in alleyways. Another nice touch is the way the guys go places in solo car convoys that look for all intents and purposes like a funeral procession.
Poor Mike, when meets a group of women at a chic party in the Hollywood Hills, he tries politeness with, "Hi, how are you ladies doing this evening?" The leader of the group immediately cuts him down to size with the definitive question, "What do you drive?"
Trent is full of advice for Mike on scoring with women. When Mike spots a prospect at a bar, Trent tells him, "I don't want you to be like the guy in the PG-13 movie where everyone hopes its going to happen. I want you to be like the guy in the rated R movie."
The script is full of references to past films. When Sue uses a gun to scare away some guys in a dark parking lot, Mike screams at him, "Haven't you seen BOYZ N THE HOOD? They are going to come back and shoot us."
The show has many well done small touches. Mike's clothes by Genevieve Tyrrell are carefully chosen examples of choices likely to turn off potential female admirers. Typical is the bad suit with the Burgundy shirt and ugly tie that he uses to impress people in Vegas.
Hang out with these guys for a while, and you may begin to feel sorry for them. They have lots of theories, but actually not a clue as to how to relate to women. Only Mike is a whole person, and we grow to care about him thanks to Jon Favreau's sympathetic and heartfelt performance. The rest of the guys deserve their empty lives.
SWINGERS runs a fast 1:35. It is rated R solely for the language which I thought fairly tame considering the subject matter. There is no violence, nudity, or sex although there are a lot of discussions about sex. The film would be fine for any teenager interested in the film. I had several good laughs and liked the show enough to recommend it and give it ** 1/2.
**** = One of the top few films of this or any year. A must see film. *** = Excellent show. Look for it. ** = Average movie. Kind of enjoyable. * = Poor show. Don't waste your money. 0 = One of the worst films of this or any year. Totally unbearable.
