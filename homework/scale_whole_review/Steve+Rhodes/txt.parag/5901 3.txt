I was really looking forward to this movie. I thought Mel Gibson could do a very interesting HAMLET, and he did.
The problem was with the direction. It was slow and plodding. I found it hard to stay awake in parts. Usually Shakespeare is so lively it is hard to keep up, but not this version.
Also, I was a bit surprised at how little any music was used. The other actors were okay except for Allan Bates who also seemed to sleep through his scenes.
Normally, I love Franco Zeffirelli and in fact one of my favorite movies is his ROMEO AND JULIET which has great intensity and interest in every scene.
I would HAMLET give it 2 stars and a thumbs down. I must in fairness point out that my wife really liked this movie. Then again, she would show if Gibson were reading the phone book.
**** = One of the top few films of this or any year. A must see film. *** = Excellent show. Look for it. ** = Average movie. Kind of enjoyable. * = Poor show. Don't waste your money. 0 = One of the worst films of this or any year. Totally unbearable.
