FH (short for an unprintable nickname) is a drug addict and the central character in Alison Maclean's JESUS' SON. FH, an unlucky loser, is played by Billy Crudup, an actor last seen unimpressively in WAKING THE DEAD. He and his girlfriend, Michelle, pass the time by shooting up. Michelle is played by Academy Award nominee Samantha Morton (SWEET AND LOWDOWN), who was better playing a mute. Although some films, most notably TRAINSPOTTING, have had some success in transforming heroin addicts into comedic subjects, addicts aren't exactly high on the list of people normally considered hilarious. JESUS' SON, based on a series of Denis Johnson short stories and adapted for the screen by no less than three screenwriters, never comes together into a cohesive or compelling story.
Although some scenes, such as the one about a guy with a hunting knife through his eye, possess a devilish black humor, most fall flat. Dennis Hopper's cameo turns unintentionally hilarious. Shaving cream keeps appearing and disappearing on his face in one of the more humorous continuity errors in some time. Most of the movie will leave you asking yourself, "What was that all about?" One of FH's obsessions, for example, is regularly being a peeping Tom watching a Mennonite couple as they go about their daily lives. One can make some guesses as to what it means, but the overwhelming feeling is that you don't care since FH is such a distant and unappealing character.
JESUS' SON runs too long at 1:49. It is rated R for graphic drug use, strong language, sexuality and some violent images and would be acceptable for high school seniors and older.
The film will be playing as part of the San Francisco International Film Festival ( http://www.sfiff.org ), which runs April 20 to May 4, 2000. It is scheduled to be released nationwide in the United States this June.
