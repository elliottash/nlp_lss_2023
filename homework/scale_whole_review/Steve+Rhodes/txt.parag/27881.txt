Writer/director Sarah Thorp's SEE JANE RUN is kinda cute. Starring Clea DuVall (GIRL, INTERRUPTED and BUT I'M A CHEERLEADER) as Jane, an unhappy L.A. waitress with a couple of quirky roommates, the movie plays like a series of impromptu comedy sketches.
Unable to kill herself since she keeps getting interrupted, Jane turns instead to a life of crime as a way to finance a pilgrimage to her promised land, Wyoming. "Crime -- the hours are good, you get to travel and you meet nice people all of the time," she decides gleefully. Helping her are her roommates, Marvin (Richmond Arquette), a writer with a permanent writer's block, and Gina (Jennifer Aspen), a perky actress with 654 auditions under her belt and zero parts. Marvin and Gina see robbery as a way to enhance their movie careers. Marvin practices his bad screenwriting, and Gina overacts with a vengeance.
Jane's downfall as a criminal is her inability to identify the right loot. What does one do with tins of Spam or pet toys for a non-existent dog? Director Sarah Thorp's only inabilities stem from inexperience. After this promising but uneven first film, expect to see her name on better films in the future.
SEE JANE RUN runs 1:30. It is not rated but might be PG-13 for language and mature subject matter. It would be acceptable for kids around 12 and up.
